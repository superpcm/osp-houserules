Introduction
About This Game
What is Old-School Essentials?
▶ A role-playing game of fantastic
adventure, where players work together
to overcome fearsome monsters, sinister plots, and deadly traps in search of
wealth, power, and glory.
▶ An old-school role-playing game,
styled after the beloved games of the
1970s and 1980s.
▶ A relatively rules-light game, where
the rules are kept simple in order to let
imagination and fast-paced action take
the spotlight.
▶ A streamlined rules set, with the books
carefully structured for maximum usability during play.
▶ A modular game that can be easily
expanded for play in many different fantastic genres and game worlds.

Advanced Fantasy
Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy
consists of a heady mixture of the best of
1970s and 1980s fantasy gaming:
▶ Streamlined core rules, founded in the
tradition of the 1980s Basic/Expert sets,
beloved for their robustness, simplicity,
and extensibility.
▶ Extra classes, options, monsters, and
magic inspired by the wondrous flavour
of the 1970s Advanced 1st edition game.
▶ The combination of these influences
results in a fantasy gaming best of both
worlds!
4

New to Role-Playing Games?
This book explains the rules of the game
in an easy to learn way. The rules, however, do not demonstrate how a role-playing
game (RPG) actually works in practice.
Some recommendations for those who
have no experience whatsoever of RPGs:
▶ By far the easiest way to learn what
RPGs are about and how they work is
to simply dive in and play! If you have
friends who already play, just ask to join
them for a game or two.
▶ The next best way to learn is to watch
other people playing. There are many live
streams and YouTube channels online.

New to Old-School Games?
Newer RPGs (i.e. post-2000) tend to
work from a different set of design principles and have somewhat different play
expectations than old-school games.
Players who are familiar with newer
RPGs but not with the old-school style of
play may find the following documents
useful (both can be found online):
▶ Principia Apocrypha, by Ben Milton,
Steven Lumpkin, and David Perry.
▶ Quick Primer for Old School Gaming,
by Matthew Finch.

A Note on Rulings
In an old-school game such as OldSchool Essentials, the rules are not
intended to cover all possible eventualities. The referee must be ready to apply
judgement to resolve any unexpected
situations which arise.

Advanced Fantasy
Gaming
Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy
provides the game rules to play in fantasy
settings inspired by the Advanced 1st
edition rules. The fundamental elements
of such settings are as follows.

Peril and Adventure
Players take on the role of characters who
are drawn to confront danger in search
of wealth, ancient secrets, and wonder.
These bold individuals are known as adventurers and are the focus of the game.
The danger and reward of adventure are
most commonly found in three types of
locations: wilderness, dungeons, and the
Underworld.

Wilderness

Forbidden forests as old as the world,
swamps haunted by the spirits of ancient tribes, wild mountain ranges, the
uncharted reaches of the high seas. Any
outdoor space where peril and adventure
can be met is classified as wilderness.

Dungeons

Forsaken ruins hiding long-forgotten
treasures, primal caverns where strange
beasts dwell, subterranean cities of alien
splendour and unimaginable wealth. Any
indoor or subterranean space where peril
and adventure can be met is classified as
a dungeon.

The Underworld

Combining features of both dungeons
and the wilderness, the Underworld is a
vast realm of caverns, tunnels, waterways,
and even subterranean seas which stretch
for hundreds (or thousands!) of miles
beneath the feet of surface dwellers.

The Fantastic
The rules assume a setting where characters come into contact with the fantastic,
otherworldly, weird, and wonderful.

Treasure

Hoards of long-forgotten gold, fabled
objects of great magical power, artefacts
crafted by the gods themselves. The
promise of attaining treasures such as
these—either for their fabulous material
value or for their fantastic powers—is the
lure that pulls many an adventurer into
perilous realms.

Monsters

Terrible creatures older than time, fearsome mythical beasts, chimeric biological experiments, bands of monstrous
beast-men, beings from otherworldly
dimensions. Such inhuman creatures
lurk in the wilderness, in dungeons, and
in the Underworld, guarding wondrous
treasures.

Magic

Forbidden practices of dark sorcery,
rituals to invoke the gods, monsters summoned from weird dimensions, sites of
eldritch power, objects bound with occult
energies. Magic is a powerful tool that
may be wielded by characters, but also by
their enemies!

Sentient Species

Fairies malevolent and kind, dwarves
in subterranean kingdoms, bestial
humanoids, mutants twisted by magic.
While humans are typically the most
widespread species in the game, other
humanoids of equal (or perhaps greater!)
intelligence also exist. Intelligent species
that are available as player characters are
termed demihumans.

5

Terminology
Basic Game Terminology
Referee

Also known as the Game Master. The
person who designs the game world and
runs game sessions for the other players,
arbitrating the rules and determining
the reactions of people and creatures
encountered.

Players

Every other participant in the game. Each
player usually runs a single character.

Player Character (PC)

The imagined character played by a player.

Party

The group of PCs who go on adventures
together.

Adventure

A series of one or more game sessions
during which the party explores a specific
location or engages with a particular plot.

Campaign

A series of adventures, usually involving
a consistent set of PCs and a consistent
game world.

Non-Player Character (NPC)

Any other character encountered by
the PCs during the game. All NPCs are
played by the referee.

Monster

Any creature encountered by the party
during an adventure. All monsters are
played by the referee.

6

Dice Rolling Notation
Similar to many other RPGs, Old-School
Essentials uses polyhedral dice, each
referred to by the number of sides it has:
▶ d4: A four-sided die.
▶ d6: A normal six-sided die.
▶ d8: An eight-sided die.
▶ d10: A ten-sided die.
▶ d12: A twelve-sided die.
▶ d20: A twenty-sided die.

Multi-Dice Rolls

In situations where multiple dice should
be rolled and the results summed, the
number of dice is noted before the “d”.
For example, “3d6” indicates that three
six-sided dice should be rolled and the
results added together.

Modifiers

Flat modifiers to the roll are applied after
the results of all dice have been summed.
For example, “3d6+2” indicates that three
six-sided dice should be rolled, the results
added together, then 2 added on top.
▶ “Natural” Results
The rules occasionally refer to the “natural” result of rolling dice (e.g. “a natural
20”). This means the number rolled on
the die, before any modifiers are applied.

Percentile Rolls (d100)

A hundred-sided die (d100, sometimes
noted as d%) can be mimicked using two
d10s: the first treated as “tens” and the
second treated as “ones”. For example, a
roll of 2 and 3 would be 23. If two 0s are
rolled, the result counts as 100.

X-in-6 Rolls

Some rules specify an X-in-6 chance of
success (e.g. 2-in-6, 3-in-6, etc.). This
indicates that 1d6 should be rolled and
the result compared against the specified
chance. If the roll is less than or equal to
the chance of success, the check succeeds.

In This Book
This book is a complete guide for players
of Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy games, with rules, character options,
and magic sufficient for decades of play—
in conjunction with the active imaginations of the players.

Core Rules
Rules for magic, battles, and exploration—covering adventures in dungeons,
the wilderness, and the high seas.

Character Options
Character classes: Thirteen exciting
classes: the nimble acrobat, the devious
assassin, the brash barbarian, the charming bard, the devout cleric, the mysterious
druid, the doughty fighter, the enigmatic
illusionist, the noble knight, the sagacious magic-user, the ardent paladin, the
stealthy ranger, and the cunning thief.
Character races: Ten classic races: the
sinister drow, the avaricious duergar, the
bold dwarf, the graceful elf, the artful
gnome, the spirited half-elf, the plucky
halfling, the outcast half-orc, the passionate human, and the stony svirfneblin.
Equipment: Full lists of adventuring gear,
weapons, armour, vehicles, and animals
that characters can purchase.
Hired help: Information on the many
types of NPC adventurers, mercenaries,
and specialists that may be hired.
Domains: Rules for constructing a
stronghold and managing a domain.

Monster Stat Blocks
While this book does not contain a
full bestiary, game statistics for a small
number of monsters are present (e.g.
for mounts which can be purchased or
monsters which can be summoned by
magic). Most monster statistics are the
same as those used for player characters
(see Game Statistics, p12), but the
following points are worth noting:
▶ HD: The number of d8s rolled to
determine the creature’s hit points. The
average hp value is listed in parentheses.
▶ Att: The attacks the creature can
make each round.
▶ MV: Creature’s movement rate.
▶ SV: Creature’s saving throw values.
▶ ML: Creature’s morale rating. See
Morale, p238.
▶ AL: Creature’s alignment.
▶ XP: XP award for defeating creature.

Spells
Complete lists of spells for bards, clerics,
drow, druids, elves, gnomes, half-elves,
illusionists, magic-users, paladins, and
rangers.

Other Books
A range of Old-School Essentials supplements are available, adding extra rules
options, character classes, equipment,
spells, monsters, and treasures to tailor
the game to different settings, genres, and
styles of play.

Mix and Match
All Old-School Essentials books are 100%
compatible and can be freely mixed and
matched! In this way, different settings
and genres may be combined.

Roll Your Own
In addition to using the supplements
published in the Old-School Essentials
product line, groups may wish to create
their own additional content, tailoring
the game to their own needs.

House Rules
None of the rules presented in this
book (or other Old-School Essentials
books) are to be taken as “gospel”. If the
players and referee wish, any rule may
be expanded, altered, or removed. Such
tweaks to the rules are known as house
rules—many groups end up with their
own unique way of playing, tailored to
their particular tastes.
That said, the rules have been carefully
designed and very thoroughly battle
tested. Many groups will be perfectly
happy with the rules as written.
Beginning players: Are advised to play
with the rules as written for some time,
before starting to change anything.

8

Compatibility
The old-school gaming scene is sitting
on a secret: a huge number of games,
despite having different brand names on
their covers, are highly compatible! This
cross-compatibility between many games
means that a great wealth of adventures,
campaign settings, and rules supplements
can be used with Old-School Essentials.

The Basic/Expert Rules
Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the 1981 edition of the world’s
most popular fantasy RPG, commonly
known as the Basic/Expert edition (B/X
for short). Any material published for the
Basic/Expert rules can be used directly
with Old-School Essentials. Decades of
adventure are at your fingertips!

Heritage
The material presented in this book represents a 100% faithful restatement of
the rules, character options, and spells
from the classic Basic/Expert game, plus
additional options and spells adapted
from the Advanced game.
It is worth noting that errors in the original Basic/Expert rules have not been
slavishly reproduced—an effort has
been made to correct obvious mistakes.
With the aim of increasing the playability of the game, areas of ambiguity
or contradiction in the Basic/Expert
core rules have also been clarified in
Old-School Essentials, while attempting
to cleave as closely as possible to the
apparent intent of the original rules.
For those with a passion for rules
archaeology, the Author’s Notes document, which goes into detail on this
topic, can be downloaded for free from
necroticgnome.com.

Other Basic/Expert Games
Over the last decade, a large number
of old-school adventure games have
been published, many of which—like
Old-School Essentials—are also closely
compatible with the Basic/Expert rules.
Material published for any game that is
designed to be compatible with the Basic/
Expert rules is easy to use with OldSchool Essentials.

Other Editions
Additionally, material published for all
20th century editions of the world’s most
popular fantasy RPG (for example, the
classic Advanced edition from the 1970s)
is also largely compatible with Old-School
Essentials.
The rules of other editions do differ
somewhat from the Basic/Expert rules, so
some amount of adaptation work may be
required in order to use these materials
with Old-School Essentials. This is not
recommended for beginning players, but
for those who are familiar with the rules,
such adaptation is not complicated.

Adaptation Guidelines
Concrete guidelines are beyond the scope
of this introduction. However, a guide
to adapting other, similar rules sets for
use with this one is available as a free
download from necroticgnome.com for
those who want more information on this
topic.

Player Characters
Game Statistics
Player characters are described, in game
terms, by a set of statistics that define
their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses
in the game world.

Ability Scores

The basic physical and mental strengths
and weaknesses of the character. There
are 6 ability scores: Strength (abbreviated
STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS),
Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON),
and Charisma (CHA). A character is
ranked in each ability score by a number
between 3–18. (3 being the worst score
possible and 18 the best.)

Class

The character’s advancement in the
game is tracked by the accumulation of
experience points. Experience points are
awarded by the referee after a successful
adventure. When the character has accumulated a certain number of experience
points, the character’s level increases.
Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each
experience level.

Prime Requisite

The ability score (or scores) that are the
most important to the character’s class.
The character’s score in these abilities
can affect the rate at which the character
accumulates experience points.

Alignment

A character may be human or one of a
number of demihuman species.

The character (and every other creature
in the game world) is aligned with one of
three cosmic principles: Law, Neutrality,
or Chaos (see Alignment, p22). This
alignment determines how certain magic
influences the character and should be
used by the player as a guideline for
role-playing the character.

Level

Hit Points (hp)

An adventuring profession to which the
character belongs. A character’s class defines their main abilities. See Character
Classes, p28.

Race

The character’s experience as an adventurer is denoted by their experience
level. Characters typically start play at 1st
level (the lowest level of adventurer) and
can increase in level through successful
adventuring. As a character goes up in
level, they gain more powerful abilities, as
defined by their class.

12

Experience Points (XP)

The character’s ability to avoid dying.
The character has a maximum hit point
total and a current hit point total, which
are tracked separately. When a character
is harmed, their current hit point total
is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the
character is dead! Rest or healing can
restore lost hit points (see p218), but
never above the character’s maximum hit
point total (this is only increased when
the character increases in level).

Hit Dice (HD)

The number of dice used to determine
the character’s maximum hit point total.
The character’s level determines the number of Hit Dice and their class determines
the type of dice rolled (i.e. d4, d6, d8).
(Some classes also gain a flat bonus to hit
points at certain levels.)

Armour Class (AC)

The character’s ability to avoid damage in
combat. AC is determined by the character’s armour and their Dexterity score.
Lower Armour Class scores are better, so
bonuses decrease the character’s AC and
penalties increase it.
Dual format: The equivalent ascending
AC is listed in square brackets, for groups
using the optional rule for Ascending AC.
(e.g. AC 5 [14]—an AC of 5, or 14 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)
Unarmoured AC: An unarmoured character has AC 9 [10].

Attack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0)

The character’s ability to hit foes in combat, determined by their class and level.
The THAC0 score indicates which row of
the attack matrix (p241) to use when attacking. Lower THAC0 scores are better.
Dual format: The equivalent attack bonus is listed in square brackets, for groups
using the optional rule for Ascending
AC. (e.g. THAC0 15 [+4]—a THAC0 of
15, or an attack bonus of +4 if using the
optional rule for Ascending AC.)
Attacking: The procedure for making attack rolls is described in Combat, p234.

Saving Throw Values

The character’s ability to avoid certain
dangerous or detrimental effects. There
are five saving throw categories: death (or
poison), wands, paralysis (or petrification), breath attacks, spells (or magic rods
or staves). The character’s saving throw
values are determined by class and level.
See Saving Throws, p217 for full details.

Ascending AC (Optional Rule)
Some groups are more familiar with
an Armour Class system where higher
scores are better. This system is known
as Ascending Armour Class (abbreviated AAC) and works as follows:
▶ Armour Class: When using AAC,
higher scores are better. Bonuses to
Armour Class increase the AAC score
and penalties decrease it.
▶ Attack rolls: When using AAC, the
procedure for resolving attack rolls involves the use of an attack bonus instead
of a THAC0 score and attack matrix.
Note: Using Ascending Armour Class
results in very slightly different attack
probabilities than when using the traditional approach of descending AC with
an attack matrix.

Movement Rate

The speed at which the character can
move when exploring, travelling, or
during combat. Every character has a
base movement rate and an encounter
movement rate (noted in parentheses).
The encounter movement rate is one
third of the base movement rate. The default movement rate for characters is 120’
(40’)—a base movement rate of 120’ and
an encounter movement rate of 40’.
▶ Overland: The number of miles a
character can travel in a day in the wilderness is determined by dividing their
base movement rate by five.
▶ Exploration: When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can
move their base movement rate in feet
per turn (10 minutes).

Class Abilities

Finally, the character’s class denotes a set
of special abilities that the character may
use, including the ability to use certain
types of armour and weapons.

character creation, one in the style of the
Basic/Expert game and one in the style of
the Advanced game.

Basic Character Creation
Using this method, an adventurer’s primary abilities are determined by a single
factor: the chosen character class.

Character Race

The character class chosen by the player
also determines the character’s race.
Unless a demihuman class is selected, the
character is human.

Advanced Character Creation
Using this method, an adventurer’s
primary abilities are determined by two
factors: their race and their class, both
chosen separately. Selecting multiple
classes may also be allowed.

Separate Race and Class

Instead of just choosing a character class,
players separately choose a race and a
class. Separating the abilities granted by a
character’s race and class leads to a much
wider range of character possibilities. For
example, rather than simply being an elf,
a character may be an elf fighter, elf thief,
elf magic-user, etc.

Multiple Classes (Optional Rule)

Optionally, players may also be allowed
to choose multiple classes for their character, enabling the creation of characters
with a wide range of mixed abilities. For
example, a magic-user/thief combines
the abilities of both classes for a powerful subterfuge-based character. See full
details opposite.

Choosing Which Method to Use
Each group must decide which character
creation method they will allow in their
games. Some groups may only allow one
of the two methods of character creation
(basic or advanced), while others may
allow each player to decide individually
which method to use.
Characters created using both methods
are completely compatible and may freely
adventure together.

Pros and Cons

The major benefit of the basic method of
character creation is the ease with which
characters can be created: experienced
players are able to go from blank character sheet to finished 1st level PC in under
10 minutes. The extra options in the
advanced method of character creation
provide an extra level of customisation,
but at the expense of a more complex and
lengthy process of character creation.

Optional Character Creation Rules
Two additional options inspired by the
Advanced game are available in both
methods of character creation, for groups
that wish to use them.
▶ Secondary skills: This optional rule
grants characters a degree of experience
in a non-adventuring profession, which
they have picked up at some point in
their lives. See Secondary Skills, p25.
▶ Weapon proficiency: This optional
rule adds an extra level of customisation,
allowing players to select the types of
weapons their characters are trained to
use. See Weapon Proficiency, p23.

Multiple Classes
(Optional Rule)

Levelling

When selecting character race and class
separately, players may optionally also
be allowed to choose more than one
class. This is a significant departure from
the standard rules, so the ramifications
should be considered very carefully:
▶ Allowing multiple classes to be chosen
greatly increases the complexity of the
character creation process.
▶ Single-classed characters tend to be
overwhelmed by characters with multiple
classes, who can do everything they can
and more. Single-classed characters advance more quickly, but the exponential
nature of the class XP tables means that
they are rarely more than one level ahead.
▶ In the traditional Advanced rules, only
demihumans were allowed to choose
multiple classes and then only in specific
combinations. The referee may consider
creating combinations of allowed classes,
emphasising the different cultures of the
various demihuman races.

Hit Points

Choosing Multiple Classes
A character may be of up to three classes,
which are selected at character creation.

Level and Experience Points
The character has a separately tracked
count of experience points per class.
When earning XP, the total earned is split
evenly between the per-class XP counts.

Prime Requisite XP Adjustments

The character’s prime requisite XP
adjustment (see Ability Scores, p20) is
calculated separately for each class, based
on the prime requisite(s) of the class. The
per-class adjustment only applies to XP
added to that class’ XP count.

The character has a separately tracked
experience level per class. When the
character has gained enough XP in one of
their classes, that class increases in level.
When determining hit points at character
creation or upon gaining a level, any hit
points gained are divided by the number
of classes. Fractions are tracked and may
add up to a whole number later on.
Example: A fighter/thief gains a thief
level. The player rolls 1d4 for hit points,
resulting in a 3. The character gains 1½
hp. Upon gaining a fighter level, the
player rolls 1d8 for hit points, resulting in
a 5. The character gains 2½ hp. The half
hit points gained for the thief and fighter
levels now add up to a whole hit point.

Saving Throws and THAC0
The character uses the best saving throw
value in each category and the best
THAC0 value of all of their classes.

Class Abilities
Allowed Armour

The character may use the best armour
options allowed to any of their classes.

Allowed Weapons

The character may use the best weapon
options allowed to any of their classes.
For the purposes of the optional weapon
proficiency rules (p23), the character is
treated as their most favourable class.

Spell Casting

The character may use the magical abilities of each class without restriction.

Stealth Skills

Class abilities such as hide in shadows
or move silently may only be used when
wearing armour that is allowed to the
class that grants the ability.

Creating a
Character:
Basic Method

3. Adjust Ability Scores

To create a character, you’ll first need
a character sheet—a sheet of paper on
which to record all information about the
new character.
A selection of different character sheet
PDFs is available at necroticgnome.com.
These may be downloaded and printed
for use in your games.

1. Roll Ability Scores
Roll 3d6 for each of your character’s ability scores: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.
See Ability Scores, p20.

Sub-Par Characters

If you roll a character with very poor
ability scores—for example an 8 or less in
every score or an extremely low rating in
more than one ability—the referee may
allow you to discard the character and
start again.

2. Choose a Class
Select one of the classes available (see
Character Classes, p28), bearing in
mind the minimum ability score requirements of some classes. The chosen class
determines your character’s race—unless
a demihuman class is selected, the character is human.

1st Level PC Attack Values
Attack Roll 10
11
8
AC Hit 9
16

If you wish, you may raise your character’s prime requisite(s) by lowering other
(non-prime requisite) ability scores. For
every 2 points by which an ability score is
lowered, 1 point may be added to a prime
requisite. The following restrictions apply:
▶ Only Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way.
▶ No score may be lowered below 9.
▶ Some character classes may have additional constraints.

4. Note Ability Score Modifiers
Now that your character’s ability scores
are fixed, make a note of any associated
bonuses or penalties (see p20).

5. Note Attack Values
The level progression chart for your
character’s class lists your THAC0 score.
This indicates your chance of hitting
opponents in combat, as determined by
the Attack Matrix, p241.
For quick reference, it is convenient to
look up the values in the attack matrix
row for your character’s THAC0 (determined by class and level) and record
them on your character sheet. 1st level
characters have a THAC0 of 19 [0], resulting in the attack values shown below.

Ascending AC (Optional Rule)

If using the optional rule for Ascending
AC (p13), record your attack bonus on
your character sheet, instead of the attack
matrix quick reference.

6. Note Saving Throws and
Class Abilities
Record any special abilities possessed by
your character as a result of their class, as
well as your character’s saving throws. If
your character has a spell book, ask your
referee which spells are recorded in it.
The referee may allow you to choose.

10. Buy Equipment
Your character has 3d6 × 10 gold pieces
(see Wealth, p90). Consult the equipment lists (see p94) and decide what to
purchase with this initial wealth.
Remember: Your chosen class may
restrict your use of some equipment (e.g.
weapons and armour).

Weapon Proficiencies (Optional Rule)

If using the optional rule for weapon
proficiency (see p23), select which
weapons your character is proficient with,
choosing from the list of weapons usable
by the character’s class.

7. Roll Hit Points
Determine your character’s hit points
by rolling the die type specified for your
class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see Ability Scores, p20).
Characters always start with at least 1 hit
point, regardless of CON modifier.

Re-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule)

If you roll a 1 or 2 (before applying any
CON modifier), the referee may allow
you to re-roll. This is in order to increase
the survivability of 1st level PCs.

11. Note Armour Class
Your character’s Armour Class is determined by two factors:
▶ Armour: The armour worn determines your character’s base AC. See the
equipment lists under Equipment, p94.
▶ Dexterity: See Ability Scores, p20.

Unarmoured AC

If your character has no armour, their
base AC is 9 [10].

8. Choose Alignment

12. Note Level and XP

Decide whether your character is Lawful,
Neutral, or Chaotic (see Alignment,
p22).

Your character begins play at 1st level
with 0 XP.

9. Note Known Languages
Your character’s native languages are
listed in the class description. This always
includes the common tongue and your
character’s alignment language. Characters with high INT may also choose additional languages. See Languages, p24.

13. Secondary Skill (Optional Rule)
If using the optional rule for secondary
skills (see p25), determine which skill
your character has.

14. Name Character
Finally, choose a name for your character.
You are now ready for adventure!

Ability Scores
A character’s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or
penalties associated with various actions
in the game. The tables opposite list the
modifiers associated with each ability
score, with the effects described below.

Strength (STR)
Brawn, muscle, and physical power.
▶ Melee: Is applied to attack and damage
rolls with melee weapons.
▶ Open doors: The chance of success
with attempts to force open a stuck door
(see Dungeon Adventuring, p222).

Intelligence (INT)
Learning, memory, and reasoning.
▶ Spoken languages: Denotes the number of languages the character can speak.
▶ Literacy: Indicates the character’s ability to read and write their native languages.

Wisdom (WIS)
Willpower, common sense, perception,
and intuition.
▶ Magic saves: Is applied to saving
throws (see p217) versus magical effects.
This does not normally include saves
against breath attacks, but may apply to
any other saving throw category.

Dexterity (DEX)
Agility, reflexes, speed, and balance.
▶ AC: Modifies the character’s AC (a
bonus lowers AC, a penalty raises it).
▶ Missile: Applied to attack rolls (but
not damage rolls) with ranged weapons.
▶ Initiative: Modifies the character’s
initiative roll, if the optional rule for
individual initiative is used (see Combat,
p234).

Constitution (CON)
Health, stamina, and endurance.
▶ Hit points: Applies when rolling a
character’s hit points (i.e. at 1st level and
every time a level is gained thereafter). A
character always gains at least 1 hit point
per Hit Die, regardless of CON modifier.

Charisma (CHA)
Force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, physical attractiveness,
and ability to lead.
▶ NPC reactions: Applies when hiring
retainers and when interacting with
monsters.
▶ Max # of retainers: Determines the
number of retainers a character may have
at any one time.
▶ Retainer loyalty: Determines retainers’ loyalty to the character.

Prime Requisite
Each character class has one or more
prime requisites—ability scores of special
importance to that class’ function. A
character’s score in their prime requisites
affects how quickly they gain XP.
▶ XP modifier: Applied to all XP
awarded to characters with a single prime
requisite. The modifiers for classes with
multiple prime requisites are noted in the
class description.

Alignment
All beings, whether PCs, NPCs, or monsters, adhere to one of three philosophies
or spheres of behaviour, known as alignments. These spheres are Law, Neutrality,
and Chaos. A player must choose one of
these paths when creating a character.
Law: Lawful beings believe in truth
and justice. To this end, they will follow
laws and believe all things must adhere
to order. Lawful beings also believe in
sacrifice to a greater good and will choose
the good of a larger group over the good
of an individual.
Neutrality: Neutral beings believe in a
balance between the ideas of Law and
Chaos and, in their actions, tend to do
what will serve themselves. They might
commit good or evil acts in order to further their own ends and generally will not
put others’ needs ahead of their own.
Chaos: Chaotic beings are in direct
opposition to Law. These beings should
seldom be trusted, for they tend to act in
“evil” ways and are utterly selfish. Chaotic
characters believe in chance and that
there is no innate order to life.

22

Revealing Alignment
The player must inform the referee of
their character’s alignment, but does not
have to tell other players.

Role-Playing Alignment
When determining the character’s
actions, players should do their best to
adhere to their chosen alignment. The
referee will take note when a character’s
behaviour deviates too much from the
norm of the chosen alignment and may
assign a new alignment more appropriate
to actual character actions. Deviation
from alignment may also be penalised, as
the referee sees fit.

Weapon Proficiency
(Optional Rule)
The weapons a character can use are
normally determined by their class. Two
characters of the same class can thus both
use the same weapons with equal skill.
This optional rule allows for further differentiation between characters by limiting the types of weapons each character is
trained to use. If using this optional rule,
each character is proficient with a limited
number of types of weapons (e.g. maces,
short swords, long bows)—the character
is comfortable using these weapons and
can use them in combat without penalty.

Martial, Semi-Martial, Non-Martial
For the sake of determining weapon proficiencies, character classes are divided
into three categories: martial, semi-martial, and non-martial. The category each
class falls under is determined by the rate
at which its THAC0 and saving throw
values improve, as follows:
▶ Martial: THAC0 and saves improve
every 3 levels (e.g. knight).
▶ Semi-martial: THAC0 and saves improve every 4 levels (e.g. acrobat).
▶ Non-martial: THAC0 and saves improve every 5 levels (e.g. illusionist).

Choosing Weapon Proficiencies
Proficient weapons may only be chosen
from the list of weapons usable by the
character’s class (also taking into account
any limitations due to the character’s
race, if the advanced character creation
method is used).

Initial Weapon Proficiencies
At character creation, before purchasing
equipment, the player should note the
weapons that the character is proficient
with. Martial characters are proficient
with 4 weapons at 1st level, semi-martial
characters with 3 weapons, and non-martial characters with 1 weapon.

Gaining Weapon Proficiencies
As the character gains experience, they
become proficient in the use of additional weapons. Every time the character’s
THAC0 and saving throw values improve, the character also gains proficiency
with a new weapon.

Non-Proficient Attacks
A character using a weapon that they are
not proficient with incurs a penalty to
attack rolls. Martial characters suffer a
–2 penalty, semi-martial characters a –3
penalty, and non-martial characters a –5
penalty.
The referee may optionally allow characters to use weapons that are restricted
by their race or class, applying the same
non-proficiency penalty in such cases.

Weapon Specialisation
Martial characters may optionally be
allowed to specialise in a single, specific
type of weapon. This requires dedicating
two weapon proficiency “slots” to a single
weapon type. For example, a 1st level
martial character is normally proficient
with 4 weapons. If the player chooses to
specialise in a weapon, the character is
only proficient with 3 weapons (the specialised weapon plus two others).
When attacking with a specialised weapon, the character gains a +1 bonus to
attack and damage rolls.
23

Languages
The native languages spoken by a player
character are determined by the character’s class (or their race, if using the advanced character creation method). These
typically include the common tongue and
an alignment language. Characters with
high INT may learn additional languages
(see Ability Scores, p20).

The Common Tongue

Other Languages

The common tongue (sometimes simply
called Common) is a language which is
widespread among intelligent species. All
player character races—as well as many
monsters—are able to speak Common.
In some settings, the referee may rule that
different cultures in the campaign world
have different languages, in which case
a particular language must be chosen
instead of Common.

Many demihuman and intelligent monster species have their own language,
which player characters may be able
to learn. The table below lists common
languages which may be chosen by player
characters with high Intelligence (at the
referee’s discretion).

Deepcommon

Creatures native to the Underworld speak
an alternative common tongue known as
Deepcommon.

Alignment Languages
All intelligent beings know a secret,
unwritten language of gestures, signs, and
code words associated with their alignment. This secret language allows beings
of the same alignment to communicate.
Beings of another alignment recognise
when an alignment language is being
used, but cannot understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language
except by changing alignment, in which
case the former language is forgotten.

Secondary Skills
(Optional Rule)
A character’s class is assumed to be their
primary profession and the focus of all
training.
This optional rule grants characters a
small degree of experience in an additional profession—called a secondary
skill—which they have picked up at some
point in their lives. This may be the profession of a parent or mentor which the
character has picked up to some degree
or it may be simply a skill that the character practises as a hobby.

Determining Secondary Skills
When creating a new character, the player should roll d100 and consult the table
to the right to determine the character’s
secondary skill. If desired, the referee
may allow a player to choose a secondary
skill rather than rolling randomly.

Using Secondary Skills
The referee must adjudicate all uses of
secondary skills. Generally speaking,
knowledge of a secondary skill allows a
character to perform the functions of a
profession at a basic level, for example:
▶ Assess the value and quality of an item
associated with the skill.
▶ Make minor repairs to items associated with the skill.
▶ Construct simple items associated with
the skill.

Acrobats are trained in skills of balance,
gymnastics, and stealth. They often work
in conjunction with thieves and may
belong to a Thieves’ Guild.
Adjust ability scores: During character
creation, acrobats may not lower STR.
Encumbrance: Evasion, falling, jumping, and tightrope walking cannot be
performed if encumbrance reduces the
acrobat’s movement rate to less than 90’
(30’) (see Encumbrance, p215).

Acrobat Skills
Acrobats can use the following skills with

▶ Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is
required for each 100’ to be climbed. If
the roll fails, the acrobat falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.
▶ Falling (FA): When able to tumble, acrobats suffer no damage from the first 10’
of any fall. Damage due to falling from
a greater height is reduced by the listed
percentage (rounding fractions down).
▶ Hide in shadows (HS): The acrobat
must be motionless—attacking or moving
while hiding is not possible.
28

▶ Move silently (MS): An acrobat may
attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.
▶ Tightrope walking (TW): Acrobats
can walk along tightropes, narrow beams,
and ledges at up to half their normal
movement rate. A roll is required every
60’. Failure indicates that the acrobat falls
and suffers falling damage. Windy conditions may reduce the chance of success
by up to 20%. Holding a balance pole
increases the chance of success by 10%.

Combat
Acrobats cannot wear armour bulkier
than leather and cannot use shields. They
are able to use all missile weapons. Their
use of melee weapons is restricted to light
blades and staff weapons.

Evasion
When retreating from melee, an acrobat’s
ability to tumble negates the opponent’s
usual +2 bonus to hit (see p234).

Jumping
With a 20’ run-up, an acrobat can jump
across a 10’ wide pit or chasm (or 20’
wide when aided by the use of a pole).
Also when using a pole, an acrobat can
jump over a 10’ high wall or onto a 10’
high ledge. Suitable poles for jumping include: 10’ poles, pole arms, spears, staves.

Tumbling Attack
Using the falling or jumping abilities, an
acrobat can make a tumbling melee attack. The attack inflicts double damage if
successful. Against an unaware opponent,
the acrobat also gains a +4 bonus to hit.

Acrobat Skills Chance of Success
Level CS FA HS MS

An acrobat can establish a training school,
attracting 2d6 apprentices of 1st level. The
apprentices will serve the character with
some reliability; however, should any be
arrested or killed, the character will not be
able to attract apprentices to replace them.
A successful acrobat burglar might use
these followers to start a Thieves’ Guild.

Rolling Skill Checks
All skills except falling are rolled on d%,
with a result of less than or equal to the
listed percentage indicating success.

Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hide in shadows and move silently on the player’s
behalf, as the acrobat always believes
the attempt to be successful. If the roll
fails, the referee knows that the acrobat
has been noticed and should determine
enemies’ actions appropriately.

Assassin
Requirements: None
Prime requisite: DEX
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common
Assassins are adventurers who specialise in the arts of infiltration and killing
by stealth. They sometimes form guilds
whereby their illicit services may be hired.
Alignment: Assassins may not be lawful.
Adjust ability scores: During character
creation, assassins may not lower STR.

Assassin Skills
Assassins can use the following skills with
the chance of success shown opposite:
▶ Assassination (AS): When attacking
an unaware humanoid from behind, an
assassin gains a +4 bonus to hit. If the
attack succeeds, the victim must save
versus death with a penalty dependent
on the assassin’s level (noted in the table
opposite). If the save fails, the victim is
instantly killed, otherwise the assassin’s
attack inflicts normal damage.
▶ Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is
required for each 100’ to be climbed. If
the roll fails, the assassin falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.
▶ Hear noise (HN): In a quiet environment (e.g. not in combat), an assassin
may attempt to listen at a door or to hear
the sounds of something (e.g. a wandering monster) approaching.
▶ Hide in shadows (HS): Requires the
assassin to be motionless—attacking or
moving while hiding is not possible.
▶ Move silently (MS): An assassin may
attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.
30

Combat
Assassins cannot wear armour bulkier
than leather but may use shields. They
can use all types of weapons.

Disguise
Characters of any class may don disguises, but assassins are masters of the art—
able to create disguises that pass even
close scrutiny.
Chance of detection: Everyone the assassin meets has a 2% chance of spotting the
disguise. This roll is repeated once every
subsequent day of meeting.
Posing as another class, race, or sex:
Increases the chance of being detected by
2% per change.
Height and weight: A disguise may alter
height (up to 3” shorter or 5” taller) or
weight (slightly thinner, much bulkier).

Hirelings
Assassins of 1st–3rd level may not employ retainers, mercenaries, or specialists.
From 4th level, an assassin may hire other
assassins of lower level. From 8th level, an
assassin may hire thieves, and from 12th
level any type of character.

Poison
Victims of a poisoning by an assassin (see
Poison, p98) suffer a –2 penalty to the
saving throw.

After Reaching 12th Level
An assassin may attempt to take over an
existing guild of assassins or thieves by
killing the old guild-master. This may be
achieved by any means (e.g. poisoning,
assassination, duel). If successful, the
character can maintain a guild of 7d4
members. 75% of the existing members
will leave, but new members (typically 1st
level assassins) will arrive over time.

Rolling Skill Checks
Hear noise: Is rolled on 1d6. If the roll is

Other skills: Are rolled on d%, with a
result of less than or equal to the listed
percentage indicating success.

Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for HN, HS, and

does not immediately know if the attempt
was successful. If an HS or MS roll fails,
the referee knows that the assassin has
been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

Barbarian
Requirements: Minimum DEX 9
Prime requisite: CON and STR
Hit Dice: 1d8
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, chainmail, shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common
Barbarians are tribal warriors from wild
lands. They are formidable fighters with
many useful survival skills but have a
deep mistrust of the arcane.
Prime requisites: A barbarian with at
least 13 in one prime requisite gains a
5% bonus to experience. If both STR and
CON are 16 or higher, the barbarian gets
a +10% bonus.
Literacy: A 1st level barbarian cannot
read or write, irrespective of INT score.

Agile Fighting
Upon reaching 4th level, a barbarian gains
a +1 AC bonus. This increases to +2 at 6th
level, +3 at 8th level, and +4 at 10th level.

Barbarian Skills
In the wilderness, barbarians can use the
following skills with the chance of success
shown opposite:
▶ Climb sheer surfaces (CS): Only applies to natural surfaces (e.g. tree trunks,
cliff faces). A skill roll is required for
each 100’ height to be climbed. Failure
indicates that the barbarian falls at the
halfway point, suffering falling damage.
▶ Hide in undergrowth (HD): Requires
the barbarian to be motionless—attacking
or moving while hiding is not possible.
▶ Move silently (MS): A barbarian may
attempt to sneak past enemies.

32

Combat
Barbarians can use all types of weapons
and can use leather armour, chainmail,
and shields.

Cure Poison
In the wilderness, a barbarian can gather
herbs to concoct an antidote to natural
poisons. This takes one turn per character
to be cured. Each subject may make a second save versus poison to end the effects.

Fear of Magic
Barbarians are mistrustful of magic and
will refuse to knowingly use or come
under the influence of spells or magic
items. Barbarians will accept divine magic
associated with their tribal religion.

Foraging and Hunting
A party with a barbarian succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey
when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance (see
Wilderness Adventuring, p224).

Strike Invulnerable Monsters
A barbarian of 4th level or higher is able
to hit monsters that can normally only be
harmed by magic.

After Reaching 8th Level
A barbarian can call upon their native
people to form a great horde of warriors,
numbering 250 per level above 7th. The
warriors are 1st level fighters with basic
combat gear and may be mounted if
customary in their culture. A horde can
only be mustered for a specific purpose
(e.g. attacking an enemy city, rescuing
hostages, etc.). Once the purpose is
achieved or abandoned, the horde disbands. Mustering a horde takes one week,
and it remains for one week per level of
the barbarian.

Player Knowledge

Bard
Requirements: Minimum DEX 9,
minimum INT 9
Prime requisite: CHA
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, chainmail, no shields
Weapons: Missile weapons, one-handed
melee weapons
Languages: Alignment, Common
Bards are members of a sect of minstrels
and warrior poets associated with the
druids. Like druids, bards worship the
force of nature and the myriad deities
that personify it. Their strengths lie in
their deep knowledge of myth and legend, the magic that they wield on behalf
of their gods, and the enchanting power
of their music.

Anti-Charm
While the bard plays music and sings, allies within 30’ are immune to song-based
magical effects and the beguiling powers of sylvan creatures or fairies. Allies
already under the effect of such magic
may make another saving throw with a
+4 bonus.

Combat
Bards can use leather armour or chainmail but do not have the training
required to use plate mail or shields.
They can use all missile weapons and all
one-handed melee weapons.

34

Divine Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on
divine magic.
Deity disfavour: Bards must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment and
religion. Bards who fall from favour with
their deity may incur penalties.
Spell casting: Once a bard has proven
their faith (from 2nd level), the character
may pray to receive spells. The power and
number of spells available to a bard are
determined by experience level. The list
of spells available to bards is found on
p129 (bards have the same spell selection as druids).
Using magic items: As spell casters,
bards can use magic scrolls of spells on
their spell list. They may also use any
items that only druids can use.

Enchantment
By playing music and singing, the bard
can fascinate subjects in a 30’ radius. This
ability does not function in combat.
Number of subjects: Up to 2HD of creatures per level of the bard are affected.
The bard may choose to target a specific
individual or a group (in which case,
the affected individuals are determined
randomly).
Types of subjects: At 1st level, the bard
can fascinate persons. At 4th level, animals may also be affected. At 7th level,
monsters may be affected.
Effect: Each subject must save versus
spells or be fascinated, as follows:
▶ Rapt: Fascinated subjects’ attention is
fully bent on the bard’s performance, as
long as it continues.
▶ Follow: The bard may walk while playing. Fascinated subjects will follow.
▶ Interruptions: If the performance is
interrupted (e.g. by loud noise or violence), the fascination ends immediately.

Charming Fascinated Subjects

Languages

If the bard performs for at least one
turn and the performance ends without
interruption, fascinated subjects may be
placed under a deeper charm. Each subject must make another save versus spells
(with a +2 bonus) or be charmed for one
turn per level of the bard:
▶ Friendship: Charmed subjects regard
the bard as a trusted friend and ally and
will come to the bard’s defence.
▶ Commands: If they share a language,
charmed subjects will obey the bard’s
commands.
▶ Alignment: Commands that contradict the charmed creature’s nature or
alignment may be ignored.
▶ Suicidal commands: Charmed subjects never obey suicidal or obviously
harmful orders.

Bards learn new languages as they advance in level. At every even numbered
level above 3rd (i.e. 4th, 6th, 8th, etc.), the
player may choose an additional language. Bards may learn the secret tongue
of druids in this way (see Druid, p40).

Lore
From 2nd level, a bard has a 2-in-6
chance of knowing lore pertaining to
monsters, magic items, or heroes of folktale or legend. This ability may be used to
identify the nature and powers of magic
items.

After Reaching 11th Level
A bard can establish a manor. 2d6 apprentice bards of 1st level will come to
study under the character.
35

Cleric
Requirements: None
Prime requisite: WIS
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Any, including shields
Weapons: Any blunt weapons
Languages: Alignment, Common
Clerics are adventurers who have sworn
to serve a deity. They are trained for battle
and channel the power of their deity.

Combat
Clerics can use all types of armour. Strict
holy doctrine prevents clerics’ use of
weapons that have a sharp, cutting edge
or stabbing point. They may use the following weapons: club, mace, sling, staff,
war hammer.

Divine Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on
divine magic.
Holy symbol: A cleric must carry a holy
symbol (see Equipment, p94).
Deity disfavour: Clerics must be faithful
to the tenets of their alignment, clergy,
and religion. Clerics who fall from favour
with their deity may incur penalties.
Magical research: A cleric of any level
may spend time and money on magical
research. This allows them to create new
spells or other magical effects associated
with their deity. When a cleric reaches
9th level, they are also able to create
magic items.

36

Spell casting: Once a cleric has proven
their faith (from 2nd level), the character
may pray to receive spells. The power and
number of spells available to a cleric are
determined by the character’s experience
level. The list of spells available to clerics
is found on p128.
Using magic items: As spell casters, clerics can use magic scrolls of spells on their
spell list. They can also use items that
may only be used by divine spell casters
(e.g. some magic staves).

Turning the Undead
Clerics can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters encountered.
To turn the undead, the player rolls 2d6.
The referee then consults the table opposite, comparing the roll against the HD of
the type of undead monsters targeted.

Successful Turning

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player
must roll 2d6 again to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).
Turned undead: Will leave the area, if
possible, and will not harm or make contact with the cleric.
Destroyed undead (result of D): Are
instantly and permanently annihilated.
Excess: Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a monster are wasted.
Minimum effect: At least one undead
monster will always be affected on a successful turning.
Mixed groups: If turn undead is used
against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the
lowest HD are affected first.

–: The turning fails.
Number: If the 2d6 turning roll is higher
or equal, the turning attempt succeeds.
T: The turning succeeds.
D: The turning succeeds; the monsters
are destroyed, not simply caused to flee.

After Reaching 9th Level
A cleric may establish or build a stronghold. So long as the cleric is currently in
favour with their god, a stronghold may
be bought or built at half the normal
price, due to divine intervention.
Once a stronghold is established, the cleric will attract followers (5d6 × 10 fighters
of level 1–2). These troops are completely
devoted to the cleric, never checking
morale. The referee decides which proportions of followers are 1st and 2nd level
and which are bowmen, infantry, etc.

Druid
Requirements: None
Prime requisite: WIS
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, wooden shields
Weapons: Club, dagger, sling, spear,
staff
Languages: Alignment, Common
Druids are priests of nature, protecting
wild lands from the encroachment of
“civilised” Law and the corrupting touch
of Chaos. They worship the force of
nature itself, personified in the form of
various nature deities.
Alignment: Druids regard the ways of
the natural world as the ideal state of
things. They see the concepts of Law and
Chaos as extremes that are both equally
against nature. Thus, druids must be
neutral in alignment.

Charm Immunity
Druids of 7th level and above are immune to the charms of fairies and Sylvan
creatures (e.g. dryads, nixies).

Combat
The holy doctrine of the druids stipulates
that they may not use metal armour or
shields (wooden shields may be purchased at the normal price). Their choice
of weapons is limited to clubs, daggers,
slings, spears, and staves.

Divine Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on
divine magic.
Holy symbol: A druid must carry a holy
symbol: a sprig of mistletoe which the
character must harvest.
40

Deity disfavour: Druids must be faithful
to the tenets of their alignment and religion. Druids who fall from favour with
their deity may incur penalties.
Magical research: A druid of any level
may spend time and money on magical
research. This allows them to create new
spells or other magical effects associated
with their deity. When a druid reaches
9th level, they are also able to create
magic items.
Spell casting: A druid may pray to
receive spells from nature. The power and
number of spells available to a druid are
determined by the character’s experience
level. The list of spells available to druids
is found on p129.
Using magic items: As spell casters, druids can use magic scrolls of spells on their
spell list. They can also use items that
may only be used by divine spell casters
(e.g. some staves). Druids may not use
magical books or tomes.

Energy Resistance
Druids gain a +2 bonus to saving throws
against electricity (lightning) and fire.

Identification
Druids can identify all plants and animals
and can discern pure water.

Languages
Druids speak a secret tongue known only
to their sect. At each level above 2nd,
a druid also learns to speak a language
used by creatures of Sylvan forests (e.g.
dryads, green dragons, pixies, treants).

Pass Without Trace
From 3rd level, a druid can pass through
natural environments without leaving any
tracks. The character is also able to move
through overgrown areas at normal speed
and without impediment.

Path-Finding

Reaching 12th Level and Above

A party with a druid has only a 1-in-6
chance of getting lost in woodlands. See
Wilderness Adventuring, p224.

There can only be nine druids of 12th level. When a druid has enough experience
to reach 12th level, they must challenge
an existing 12th level druid. The character only advances to 12th level if the
other druid is defeated. Such challenges
may take any form that is agreed by both
parties, including combat (which need
not be fatal). Likewise, there can only be
three druids of 13th level and a single
druid (known as the arch-druid) of 14th
level.
Druids who attain 12th level or above
may build a stronghold integrated into a
natural setting.

Shape Change
At 7th level, a druid gains the power to
change into the form of a reptile, bird,
and mammal (once per day each). The
animal may be of any size up to around
twice the bulk of the druid’s normal form.
If a druid has lost hit points, they regain
1d4 hit points per level upon changing
into an animal. All equipment carried
by the druid is absorbed into the animal form and reappears when the druid
changes back.

Duergar
Demihuman Class
Requirements: Minimum CON 9,
minimum INT 9
Prime requisite: STR
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 10
Armour: Any, including shields
Weapons: Small or normal sized
Languages: Alignment, Common,
Deepcommon, Dwarvish, Gnomish,
Goblin, Kobold
Duergars (grey dwarves) are scrawny,
bearded demihumans with grey skin and
hair and gnarled faces. They are around 4’
tall, about 120 pounds, and have lifespans
of up to 500 years. Duergars dwell in
strongholds and cities deep underground.
They are renowned for their greed for
precious metals and stones and for their
xenophobia toward other races. Duergars
have a naturally strong constitution and
are highly resistant to magic.

Combat
Duergars can use all types of armour. Due
to their short height, they can only use
small or normal sized weapons. They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

Detect Construction Tricks
As expert miners, duergars have a 2-in6 chance of being able to detect new
construction, sliding walls, or sloping
passages when searching.

Detect Room Traps
Due to their expertise with construction, duergars have a 2-in-6 chance of
detecting non-magical room traps when
searching (see Dungeon Adventuring,
p222).
44

Infravision
Duergars have infravision to 90’ (see
Darkness, p220).

Light Sensitivity
When in bright light (daylight, continual
light), duergars suffer a –2 penalty to
attack rolls and a –1 penalty to AC.

Listening at Doors
Duergars have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing
noises (see Dungeon Adventuring,
p222).

Mental Powers
Once per day per level, a duergar may activate one of the following mental powers:
▶ Enlargement: The duergar’s body,
clothing, and armour (but not other equipment) double in size for 1d4
rounds. While enlarged, the duergar’s
melee attacks inflict double damage.
▶ Invisibility: The duergar disappears
from the sight of one or more creatures
(selected when the power is activated) for
one turn. Up to 1HD of creatures per level of the duergar are affected. In combat,
affected creatures may attack the duergar
with a –4 penalty after the first round.
▶ Shrinking: The duergar and all equipment shrinks to 6” tall for up to one turn
per level. While shrunk, the duergar can
slip through narrow spaces and, when
remaining motionless, has a 90% chance
of going unnoticed. A shrunk duergar
cannot harm creatures larger than 1’ tall.
▶ Heat: A creature or object within sight
is subjected to a scorching heat. Paper or
cloth ignite, liquids boil, and metals glow.
The heat lasts for one round per level of
the duergar. Applied to flesh or to metal
in contact with a creature (e.g. armour),
the heat inflicts 1d4 damage per round.

A duergar must spend a round concentrating in order to activate a mental
power. While concentrating, the duergar
may not move, attack, or perform any
other actions.
In combat: Like spell casting, activating a
mental power can be disrupted in combat
(see Spell Casting under Combat, p234).
The player must declare the use of a mental power before initiative is rolled.

Stealth
Underground, duergars have a 3-in-6
chance of moving silently.

After Reaching 9th Level
A duergar has the option of creating an
underground stronghold that will attract
duergars from far and wide. Duergars
usually live in clans, so duergars of the
character’s clan will be attracted to live
under their roof. Duergars from other
clans will generally be friendly and may
collaborate in times of war or disaster.
A duergar ruler may only hire duergar
mercenaries. Specialists and retainers of
any race may be hired.

Demihuman Class
Requirements: Minimum INT 9
Prime requisite: INT and STR
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 10
Armour: Any, including shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common,
Elvish, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, Orcish
Elves are slender, fey demihumans with
pointed ears. They typically weigh about
120 pounds and are between 5 and 5½
feet tall. Elves are seldom met in human
settlements, preferring to feast and make
merry in the woods. If crossed, they are
dangerous enemies, as they are masters of
both sword and spell. Elves are fascinated by spells and beautifully constructed
magic items and love to collect both.
Prime requisites: An elf with at least 13
INT and STR gains a 5% bonus to experience. An elf with an INT of at least 16
and a STR of at least 13 receives a +10%
XP bonus.

Arcane Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on
arcane magic.
Magical research: An elf of any level
may spend time and money on magical
research. This allows them to add new
spells to their spell book and to research
other magical effects. When an elf reaches 9th level, they are also able to create
magic items.

48

Spell casting: Elves carry spell books
containing the formulae for arcane spells.
The level progression table (opposite)
shows both the number of spells in the
elf ’s spell book and the number they may
memorize, determined by the character’s
experience level. Thus, a 1st level elf has
one spell in their spell book, selected by
the referee (who may allow the player
to choose). The list of spells available to
elves is found on p131 (elves have the
same spell selection as magic-users).
Using magic items: As spell casters, elves
are able to use magic scrolls of spells on
their spell list. They can also use items
that may only be used by arcane spell
casters (e.g. magic wands).

Combat
Elves can use all types of weapons and
armour.

Detect Secret Doors
Elves have keen eyes that allow them,
when actively searching, to detect hidden
and secret doors with a 2-in-6 chance
(see Dungeon Adventuring, p222).

Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis
Elves are completely unaffected by the
paralysis that ghouls can inflict.

Infravision
Elves have infravision to 60’ (see Darkness, p220).

Listening at Doors
Elves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing
noises (see Dungeon Adventuring,
p222).

An elf may construct a stronghold in the
depths of the forest, blending in with the
natural environment of a site of great
beauty, for example: in the treetops,
beside a serene valley, or hidden behind a
waterfall. Whatever material it is made of,
the construction costs as much as similar

Gnomes are a race of short demihumans
with long noses and beards. They are
cousins of the dwarves and the two races
are on friendly terms. Gnomes prefer
to dwell in underground complexes in
forests or foothills. They love mining,
precious stones, and machinery—from
miniature marvels of clockwork to great
construction engines. Gnomes are also
famed for their penchant for pointy, red,
felt hats. Gnomes are typically around
3½’ tall and weigh around 100 pounds.

Detect Construction Tricks

Speak with Burrowing Mammals

As expert tunnellers, gnomes have a
2-in-6 chance of being able to detect new
construction, sliding walls, or sloping
passages when searching.

Gnomes often keep burrowing mammals such as badgers and moles as pets.
They know the secret language of such
creatures.

Hiding

After Reaching 8th Level

Gnomes have an uncanny ability to disappear from sight:
▶ In woodland cover, a gnome can hide
with a 90% chance of success.
▶ In dungeons, a gnome can hide in
shadows or behind other forms of cover.
The chance of success is 2-in-6. Hiding
requires the gnome to be motionless.

A gnome has the option of creating an
underground stronghold that will attract
gnomes from far and wide.
Because of gnomes’ connection with
burrowing mammals, all such creatures
within 5 miles of the stronghold will
become friends with the gnomes. They
may warn of intruders, carry messages
and news, and so on. In exchange for this
friendship, the gnome must protect the
animals from harm.
Gnome rulers can hire members of
other races in the capacity of retainers or
specialists, but only soldiers of gnomish
stock may be hired.

Infravision
Gnomes have infravision to 90’ (see
Darkness, p220).

Listening at Doors
Gnomes have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see Dungeon Adventuring,
p222).

having the innate beauty of elves and
the robust physique of humans. They are
human-like in stature but always have a
feature that marks their elven heritage

Half-Orc
Demihuman Class
Requirements: None
Prime requisite: DEX and STR
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 8
Armour: Leather, chainmail, shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common,
Orcish
Half-orcs are the rare offspring of orcs
and humans. They are human-like in stature and appearance, but usually have at
least one feature that marks their orcish
heritage (e.g. fangs or a pig-like snout).
Due to the common animosity between
orcs and humans, half-orcs are typically
outcasts from both their parent cultures,
living on the fringes of society and making a living by whatever means they can.
Half-orc adventurers are capable combatants and have some skill as thieves.
Prime requisites: A half-orc with at least
13 DEX and STR gains a 5% bonus to experience. A half-orc with at least 16 DEX
and STR gains a 10% bonus.

Back-Stab
When attacking an unaware opponent
from behind, a half-orc receives a +4 bonus to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

Combat
Half-orcs can use all types of weapons
and can use leather armour, chainmail,
and shields.

Infravision
Half-orcs have infravision to 60’ (see
Darkness, p220).

60

Retainers
Half-orcs often have difficulty gaining the
trust of humans and demihumans, due
to orcs’ chaotic tendencies. Retainers in a
half-orc’s employ have their loyalty score
reduced by one. (This does not apply to
retainers who are also half-orcs.)

Thieving Skills
Half-orcs can use the following skills,
with the chance of success shown opposite:
▶ Hide in shadows (HS): Requires the
half-orc to be motionless—attacking or
moving while hiding is not possible.
▶ Move silently (MS): A half-orc may
attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.
▶ Pick pockets (PP): If the victim is
above 5th level, the half-orc’s roll is
penalised by 5% for every level above 5th.
A roll of more than twice the percentage required for success means that the
attempted theft is noticed. The referee
should determine the reaction of the
victim (possibly using the reaction table
under Encounters, p228).

After Reaching 8th Level
A half-orc can establish a bandit stronghold, attracting 2d6 apprentices—1st
level fighters, thieves, or half-orcs. These
apprentices will serve the character with
some reliability; however, should any be
arrested or killed, the PC will not be able
to attract apprentices to replace them.
A successful half-orc might use these
followers to start a Thieves’ Guild.

Rolling Skill Checks
All skills are rolled on d%, with a result of
less than or equal to the listed percentage
indicating success.

Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hide in shadows and move silently on the player’s
behalf, as the half-orc always believes
the attempt to be successful. If the roll
fails, the referee knows that the half-orc
has been noticed and should determine
enemies’ actions appropriately.

Illusionist
Requirements: Minimum DEX 9
Prime requisite: INT
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: None
Weapons: Dagger, staff (optional)
Languages: Alignment, Common
Illusionists are adventurers who study
the arcane arts of illusion and deception.
Through this study, they have learned to
cast magic spells.

Arcane Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on
arcane magic.
Magical research: An illusionist of any
level may spend time and money on
magical research. This allows them to
add new spells to their spell book and to
research other magical effects. When an
illusionist reaches 9th level, they are also
able to create magic items. Researched
spells, effects, and magic items must be
within the scope of the illusionist class, as
judged by the referee.
Spell casting: Illusionists carry spell
books containing the formulae for arcane
spells. The level progression table (opposite) shows both the number of spells
in the illusionist’s spell book and the
number they may memorize, determined
by the character’s experience level. Thus,
a 1st level illusionist has one spell in their
spell book, selected by the referee (who
may allow the player to choose). The list
of spells available to illusionists is found
on p130.

62

Using magic items: As spell casters,
illusionists are able to use magic scrolls of
spells on their spell list. They can also use
items that may only be used by arcane
spell casters (e.g. magic wands). They are,
however, not able to use magic items with
effects that cause direct damage (e.g. a
wand that shoots fireballs).

Combat
Illusionists can only use daggers and are
unable to use shields or wear any kind of
armour. This makes them very vulnerable
in combat.

Illusionists and Staves (Optional Rule)

Optionally, illusionists may be allowed to
wield a staff in combat.

After Reaching 11th Level
An illusionist may build a stronghold,
often a great tower. 1d6 apprentices of
levels 1–3 will then arrive to study under
the illusionist.

Knight
Requirements: Minimum CON 9,
minimum DEX 9
Prime requisite: STR
Hit Dice: 1d8
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Chainmail, plate mail, shields
Weapons: Melee weapons
Languages: Alignment, Common
Knights are warriors who serve a noble
house or knightly order, carrying out
their liege’s command and upholding the
honour of the liege at all costs. They are
masters of heavily armoured, mounted
combat, preferring the lance above all
other weapons. Knights are often members of the noble classes, but a person of
lowlier origin may be initiated as a knight
as a reward for noble deeds.
Knighthood: Knights of 1st and 2nd level
are known as “squires” and are not yet
regarded as true knights. Upon reaching
3rd level, the character is knighted by
their liege and gains the right to bear a
coat of arms (typically emblazoned upon
the knight’s shield).
Alignment: A knight must have the same
alignment as their liege.

Chivalric Code
Knights are bound by a stringent code of
honour, which they strive to uphold in all
their deeds. A knight does not earn any
experience points for deeds performed
at odds with this code. The fundamentals
of this code are: preference of death over
dishonour; service of the knight’s liege
as the greatest honour; glory in single
combat; defence to the death of any in the
knight’s charge; honouring of superiors;
respect of equals; demanding obedience
from inferiors; scorning the ignoble.
64

Dishonour: A knight who brings dishonour upon themselves or their liege (this
may include changing alignment) may
have their knighthood revoked. In this
case, the character becomes a fighter of
equivalent level. It may be possible to regain the status of knighthood by performing a special quest.

Combat
Knights can use all melee weapons but
cannot use missile weapons (they regard
these as dishonourable). They can wear
any metal armour but scorn non-metal
armour as only suitable for peasants and
villains.
Prowess of arms: Knights regard armour
as a symbol of prowess and status, always
favouring the most impressive and impervious-looking armour available.
Single combat: In a battle, a knight must
attack the most powerful or worthy foe in
single combat.

Flying Mounts
A knight of 5th level or higher can train
fantastic, flying monsters as mounts. This
takes one month. In general, a knight
may train flying monsters of Hit Dice at
most equal to the knight’s level. The use
and training of flying monsters as mounts
is at the referee’s discretion.

Horsemanship
Assessing steeds: Knights are expert
riders and can assess the worth of any
steed. This allows a knight to determine
whether an animal has low, average, or
high hit points for its type.
Urging great speed: From 5th level, a
knight can urge their steed to great speed,
increasing its movement rate by 30’ (10’)
for up to 6 turns, once per day.

Hospitality

Beguilement: Knights gain a +4 bonus to
saving throws against hold spells, charms,
mind control, hypnotism, suggestion, etc.
They gain a +2 bonus to saving throws
against illusion, and gain a saving throw
(one is not normally allowed) against
sleep spells.

A knight of 3rd level or higher can
expect hospitality and aid from nobles
and other knights of the same alignment
or social affiliation (e.g. order, religion,
noble house, etc.). A knight is expected to
extend such hospitality in kind.

Mounted Combat
Knights gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls
when mounted.

Strength of Will
Fear: Knights are immune to all supernatural fear effects. From 3rd level,
companions within 10’ of the knight gain
a +2 bonus on saving throws against fear
effects, and retainers and mercenaries
under the knight’s command within 10’
gain a +2 bonus to loyalty or morale.

Stronghold
Any time a knight of 3rd level or higher wishes (and has sufficient money),
they can build a castle or stronghold
and control the surrounding lands. The
permission of the knight’s liege is always
required.

After Reaching 9th Level
A knight may be granted a title such
as Baron or Baroness. The land under
the knight’s control is then known as a
Barony.

Magic-User
Requirements: None
Prime requisite: INT
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: None
Weapons: Dagger, staff (optional)
Languages: Alignment, Common
Magic-users are adventurers whose study
of arcane secrets has taught them how to
cast spells. Magic-users are able to cast a
greater number of increasingly powerful
spells as they advance in level.

Arcane Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on
arcane magic.
Magical research: A magic-user of any
level may spend time and money on
magical research. This allows them to
add new spells to their spell book and to
research other magical effects. When a
magic-user reaches 9th level, they are also
able to create magic items.
Spell casting: Magic-users carry spell
books containing the formulae for arcane
spells. The spell casting chart (opposite)
shows both the number of spells in the
magic-user’s spell book and the number
they may memorize, determined by the
character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st
level magic-user has one spell in their
spell book, selected by the referee (who
may allow the player to choose). The list
of spells available to magic-users is found
on p131.
Using magic items: As spell casters,
magic-users are able to use magic scrolls
of spells on their spell list. They can also
use items that may only be used by arcane
spell casters (e.g. magic wands).

66

Combat
Magic-users can only use daggers and are
unable to use shields or wear any kind of
armour. This makes them very vulnerable
in combat.

Magic-Users and Staves (Optional Rule)

Optionally, magic-users may be allowed
to wield a staff in combat.

After Reaching 11th Level
A magic-user may build a stronghold,
often a great tower. 1d6 apprentices of
levels 1–3 will then arrive to study under
the magic-user.

Paladin
Requirements: Minimum CHA 9
Prime requisite: STR and WIS
Hit Dice: 1d8
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Any, including shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common
Paladins are warriors sworn by sacred
oath to the service of a Lawful holy order.
Alignment: A paladin must be lawful.
If the character’s alignment ever changes (for any reason), they lose all class
abilities and become a fighter of the same
level. The referee may allow the character
to perform a quest of atonement in order
to regain their status as a paladin.
Prime requisites: A paladin with at least
13 in one prime requisite gets +5% to
experience. If both STR and WIS are 16
or higher, the paladin gets a +10% bonus.

Combat
Paladins can use all types of weapons and
armour.

Divine Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on
divine magic.
Holy symbol: A paladin must carry a
holy symbol (see the equipment list).
Deity disfavour: Paladins must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment and
religion. Paladins who fall from favour
with their deity may incur penalties.
Spell casting: From 9th level, a paladin
may pray to receive spells. The power and
number of spells available to a paladin are
determined by the character’s experience
level. The list of spells available to paladins is found on p128 (paladins have the
same spell selection as clerics).
68

Holy Resistance
Paladins are immune to all disease.

Laying on Hands
Once per day, a paladin can heal 2 hit
points per level by laying their hands on
wounded characters. Additionally, a paladin of 5th level or higher may cure disease
once per week by laying on hands.

Turning the Undead
Paladins of 3rd level and higher can
invoke the power of their deity to repel
undead monsters encountered. To turn
the undead, the player rolls 2d6. The
referee then consults the table opposite,
comparing the roll against the HD of the
type of undead monsters targeted.

Successful Turning

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player
must roll 2d6 again to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).
Turned undead: Will leave the area, if
possible, and will not harm or make contact with the paladin.
Destroyed undead: Are instantly and
permanently annihilated.
Excess HD and minimum effect: Rolled
Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a
monster are wasted. However, at least one
undead monster will always be affected
on a successful turning.
Mixed groups: If turn undead is used
against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the
lowest HD are affected first.

After Reaching 9th Level
With the permission of their holy order,
a paladin can build a castle or stronghold
and control the surrounding lands. The
paladin may be granted a title such as
Baron or Baroness. The land under their
control is then known as a Barony.

are determined by the character’s experience level. The list of spells available to
rangers is found on p129 (rangers use
the druid spell list).

Foraging and Hunting
A party with a ranger succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey
when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance (see
Wilderness Adventuring, p224).

Rangers are members of a secret society
which protects their native lands from
invasion and the influence of Chaos. They
are skilled warriors who are adapted to
life in the wilds. At higher levels, their
connection with nature grants them the
ability to cast spells.
Alignment: As protectors, rangers may
only be lawful or neutral. If a ranger ever
changes alignment to chaotic, they lose
all special class abilities and become a
fighter of the same level. The character
may be able to regain their ranger status
by performing a special quest.

70

Awareness

Limited Possessions

Rangers are only surprised on a roll of 1.
This may mean that a ranger is able to act
in the surprise round while their companions are surprised.

A ranger may only keep wealth and possessions that can be kept on their person
or mount. Excess must be donated to
worthy causes (not other PCs!).

Combat

Pursuit

Rangers can use all types of weapons and
can use leather armour, chainmail, and
shields. Because of their need for stealth,
they cannot use plate mail.

When the ranger’s party pursues an
opposing group in the wilderness (see
Evasion and Pursuit, p230), the chance
of evasion is reduced by 10%.

Divine Magic

Stealth

See Magic, p122 for full details on
divine magic.
Spell casting: From 8th level, due to a
deep connection with nature, a ranger

In the wilderness, a ranger has a 3-in-6
chance of hiding and a 3-in-6 chance of
moving silently.

Tracking
Rangers can identify and follow tracks.
This skill improves as the character gains
levels (see the table to the right). Success
may be modified by the following factors:
▶ Soft/hard ground: +20% to –50%.
▶ Size of group being tracked: +2% per
creature beyond the first.
▶ Passing through an area where other
tracks mingle: –50%.
▶ Age of tracks: –5% per 12 hours.
▶ Rainfall: –25% per hour.
▶ Efforts made to hide tracks: –25%.

After Reaching 10th Level
2d12 beings will join the ranger as followers. The nature of these followers is up to
the referee—they may include human or
demihuman adventurers, animals, fantastic mounts, sylvan creatures, or special
monsters. If any of the followers die, they
are not replaced.

Svirfneblin
Demihuman Class
Requirements: Minimum CON 9
Prime requisite: STR
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 8
Armour: Any appropriate to size, including shields
Weapons: Any appropriate to size
Languages: Alignment, Common,
Deepcommon, Gnomish, Dwarvish,
Kobold, the language of earth elementals
Short, thickset demihumans with long
noses and gnarled, hairless, grey skin.
Svirfneblins (also known as deep gnomes)
are subterranean cousins of the gnomes
who live close to the surface. Svirfneblins
are skilled tunnellers and makers of mechanical contraptions and cunning secret
doors. They love gems above all else and
excavate their communities around veins
of precious stones. Svirfneblins are typically around 3½’ tall and weigh around
120 pounds.

Blend into Stone
Svirfneblins have the uncanny ability to
go unnoticed when in an environment
of natural or carved stone so long as they
remain silent and motionless. The chance
of success is 4-in-6 in gloomy conditions
or 2-in-6 in well-lit conditions.

Combat
Svirfneblins can use all types of armour.
Armour must be tailored to svirfneblins’
small size. Likewise, svirfneblins can only
use weapons appropriate to their stature
(as determined by the referee). They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

72

Defensive Bonus
Due to their small size, svirfneblins gain a
+2 bonus to Armour Class when attacked
by large opponents (greater than humansized).

Detect Construction Tricks
As expert tunnellers, svirfneblins have a
2-in-6 chance of being able to detect new
construction, sliding walls, or sloping
passages when searching.

Illusion Resistance
Svirfneblins gain a +2 bonus to all saving
throws against illusions.

Infravision
Svirfneblins have infravision to 90’ (see
Darkness, p220).

Light Sensitivity

Using Magic Items

When in bright light (daylight, continual
light), svirfneblins suffer a –2 penalty to
attack rolls and a –1 penalty to AC.

Svirfneblins can use all magic items
(except for spell scrolls) which deal with
summoning or controlling earth elementals. This includes items that can normally only be used by spell casters.

Speak with Earth Elementals
Svirfneblins can speak the grinding,
growling tongue of natives of the elemental plane of earth.

Stone Murmurs
Svirfneblins can understand the imperceptible grumblings of stone. If a svirfneblin stands quietly for one turn with
their ear pressed against a stone surface,
they have a 2-in-6 chance of divining one
of the following pieces of information
(player’s choice):
▶ The presence of secret doors in the
stone, within 10’.
▶ The presence of gems or precious metals, up to 30’ beyond the surface.
▶ The presence of living creatures, up to
30’ beyond the surface.
▶ The presence of bodies of water or
open spaces, up to 60’ beyond the surface.

After Reaching 8th Level
A svirfneblin may construct a subterranean stronghold that will attract svirfneblins from far and wide.
Because of svirfneblins’ connection with
earth elementals, 1d3 16 HD earth elementals (see Conjure Elemental, p204)
will live in the rocks around the stronghold and will be friendly with the svirfneblins. They may warn of intruders, carry
messages and news, etc. The elementals
will also protect the svirfneblins in times
of grave danger. However, in exchange
a svirfneblin ruler must always defend
earth elementals within the svirfneblins’
territory.
Svirfneblin rulers can hire members of
other races in the capacity of retainers or
specialists, but only soldiers of svirfneblin
stock may be hired.
73

Thief
Requirements: None
Prime requisite: DEX
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, no shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common
Thieves are adventurers who live by their
skills of deception and stealth. Their
range of unique skills makes them very
handy companions in adventures. However, thieves are not always to be trusted.
Adjust ability scores: During character
creation, thieves may not lower STR.

Back-Stab
When attacking an unaware opponent
from behind, a thief receives a +4 bonus
to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

Combat
Because of their need for stealth and free
movement, thieves cannot wear armour
heavier than leather and cannot use
shields. They can use any weapon.

Read Languages
A thief of 4th level or higher can read
non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes)
with 80% probability. If the roll does not
succeed, the thief may not try to read that
particular text again before gaining an
experience level.

Scroll Use
A thief of 10th level or higher can cast
arcane spells from scrolls. There is a 10%
chance of error: the spell does not function as expected and creates an unusual
or deleterious effect.
74

Thief Skills
Thieves can use the following skills, with
the chance of success shown opposite:
▶ Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is
required for each 100’ to be climbed. If
the roll fails, the thief falls at the halfway
point, suffering falling damage.
▶ Find or remove treasure traps (TR):
A roll is required to find a treasure trap
and then another to remove it. This may
be attempted only once per trap.
▶ Hear noise (HN): In a quiet environment (e.g. not in combat), a thief may
attempt to listen at a door or to hear the
sounds of something (e.g. a wandering
monster) approaching.
▶ Hide in shadows (HS): Requires the
thief to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.
▶ Move silently (MS): A thief may attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.
▶ Open locks (OL): Requires thieves’
tools (see Equipment, p94). A thief can
only try this skill once per lock. If the roll
fails, the thief may not try the same lock
again before gaining an experience level.
▶ Pick pockets (PP): If the victim is
above 5th level, the thief ’s roll is penalised by 5% for every level above 5th.
There is always at least a 1% chance of
failure. A roll of more than twice the
percentage required for success means
that the attempted theft is noticed. The
referee should determine the reaction of
the victim (possibly using the reaction
table under Encounters, p228).

After Reaching 9th Level
A thief can establish a thief den, attracting 2d6 apprentices of 1st level. These
thieves will serve the character with
some reliability; however, should any be
arrested or killed, the PC will not be able
to attract apprentices to replace them. A
successful thief might use these followers
to start a Thieves’ Guild.

Hear noise: Is rolled on 1d6. If the roll is
within the listed range of numbers, the
skill succeeds.
Other skills: Are rolled on d%, with a
result of less than or equal to the listed
percentage indicating success.

Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hear noise,
hide in shadows, and move silently on
the player’s behalf, as the thief does not
immediately know if the attempt was
successful. If a hide in shadows or move
silently roll fails, the referee knows that
the thief has been noticed and should
determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

75

76

77

Character Races
(Optional Rule)
Class and Level Restrictions
Not all races are equally suited to every
character class. Each demihuman race
lists the classes that may be selected,
as well as the maximum level to which
characters of that race and class may rise.
Restrictions to class and maximum level
represent a race’s suitability to different
adventuring professions. For example,
dwarves are inherently non-magical and
so cannot be magic-users, halflings do
not have a natural aptitude to warfare
and can only advance to 6th level in the
fighter class, and so on.
Racial class and level limits also work as
a balancing factor in the rules, offsetting
the extra abilities granted by demihuman
races with strict limits on class choice and
level advancement.

78

Lifting Class and Level Restrictions
(Optional Rule)
In practice, many groups do not enforce
the class and level restrictions of demihuman races. For groups who wish to lift
these restrictions, it is worth bearing in
mind that this change will eradicate the
sole advantage of the Human race—its
unique access to some classes and its
unlimited level advancement—making
humans relatively underpowered. For this
reason, optional racial abilities are given
for the Human race. The referee should
consider using these if the group wishes
to eradicate class or level limitations for
demihumans. (These abilities should also
be granted to human PCs who were created without using the rules for separate
race and class!)

Languages: Alignment, Common,
Halfling
Halflings are small, rotund demi-humans
with furry feet and curly hair. They weigh
about 60 pounds and are around 3’ tall.
Halflings are a friendly and welcoming
folk. Above all, they love the comforts
of home—they are not known for their
bravery. Halflings who gain treasure
through adventuring will often use their
wealth in pursuit of a quiet, comfortable
life.

Available Classes and Max Level
▶ Druid*: 6th
▶ Fighter: 6th
▶ Thief: 8th
* At the referee’s option, halfling druids
may only exist as NPCs.

Halflings have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see Dungeon Adventuring,
p222).

Combat

Missile Attack Bonus

Armour must be tailored to halflings’
small size. Likewise, halflings can only
use weapons appropriate to their stature
(as determined by the referee). They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

Halflings’ keen coordination grants them
a +1 bonus to attack rolls with all missile
weapons.

Defensive Bonus

Halflings’ natural constitution and
resistance to magic grants them a bonus
to saving throws versus poison, spells,
and magic wands, rods, and staves. This
bonus depends on a halfling’s CON score,
as follows:
▶ 6 or lower: No bonus
▶ 7–10: +2
▶ 11–14: +3
▶ 15–17: +4
▶ 18: +5

Due to their small size, halflings gain a
+2 bonus to Armour Class when attacked
by large opponents (greater than human-sized).

Initiative Bonus (Optional Rule)
If using the optional rule for individual
initiative (see Combat, p234), halflings
get a bonus of +1 to initiative rolls.

Half-Orc

Human

Requirements: None
Ability modifiers: –2 CHA, +1 CON,
+1 STR
Languages: Alignment, Common,
Orcish

Requirements: None
Ability modifiers: None
Languages: Alignment, Common

Half-orcs are the rare offspring of orcs
and humans. They are human-like in stature and appearance, but usually have at
least one feature that marks their orcish
heritage (e.g. fangs or a pig-like snout).
Due to the common animosity between
orcs and humans, half-orcs are typically
outcasts from both their parent cultures,
living on the fringes of society and making a living by whatever means they can.

Available Classes and Max Level
▶ Acrobat: 8th
▶ Assassin: 8th
▶ Cleric: 4th
▶ Fighter: 10th
▶ Thief: 8th

Infravision
Half-orcs have infravision to 60’ (see
Darkness, p220).

Humans are renowned for the deep passions that drive them through their short
lives. They have the potential to become
great leaders, forging alliances between
other races, but they are easily corrupted.
Humans do not have any racial abilities
but are the most flexible race, being able
to select any class and advance without
limits to experience level. (Other races,
have a limited choice of character class
and strict limits on maximum level.)

Available Classes and Max Level
All non-demihuman classes: Unlimited

Racial Abilities (Optional Rule)
If the optional rule for lifting demihuman
class and level restrictions is used (see
p78), it is recommended that the loss
of human characters’ main advantage (i.e.
unlimited advancement in any class) be
compensated by the following abilities.

Ability Modifiers

+1 CHA, +1 CON.

Blessed

When rolling hit points (including at 1st
level), the player of a human PC may roll
twice and take the best result.

Decisiveness

When an initiative roll is tied, humans act
first, as if they had won initiative. If using
the optional rule for individual initiative (see Combat, p234), humans get a
bonus of +1 to initiative rolls.

Leadership

All of a human’s retainers and mercenaries gain a +1 bonus to loyalty and morale.

Svirfneblin
Requirements: Minimum CON 9
Ability modifiers: None
Languages: Alignment, Common,
Deepcommon, Gnomish, Dwarvish,
Kobold, the language of earth elementals
Short, thickset demihumans with long
noses and gnarled, hairless, grey skin.
Svirfneblins (also known as deep gnomes)
are subterranean cousins of the gnomes
who live close to the surface. Svirfneblins
are skilled tunnellers and makers of mechanical contraptions and cunning secret
doors. They love gems above all else and
excavate their communities around veins
of precious stones. Svirfneblins are typically around 3½’ tall and weigh around
120 pounds.

Available Classes and Max Level
▶ Assassin: 8th
▶ Cleric*: 7th
▶ Fighter: 6th
▶ Illusionist: 7th
▶ Thief: 8th
* At the referee’s option, svirfneblin clerics may only exist as NPCs.

Blend into Stone
Svirfneblins have the uncanny ability to
go unnoticed when in an environment
of natural or carved stone so long as they
remain silent and motionless. The chance
of success is 4-in-6 in gloomy conditions
or 2-in-6 in well-lit conditions.

Combat
Armour must be tailored to svirfneblins’
small size. Likewise, svirfneblins can only
use weapons appropriate to their stature
(as determined by the referee). They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

Defensive Bonus
Due to their small size, svirfneblins gain
a +2 AC bonus when attacked by large
opponents (greater than human-sized).

Detect Construction Tricks
Svirfneblins have a 2-in-6 chance of detecting new construction, sliding walls, or
sloping passages when searching.

Infravision
Svirfneblins have infravision to 90’ (see
Darkness, p220).

Light Sensitivity
When in bright light (daylight, continual
light), svirfneblins suffer –2 to attack rolls
and a –1 penalty to Armour Class.

Listening at Doors
Svirfneblins have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see Dungeon Adventuring,
p222).

Illusion Resistance
Svirfneblins gain a +2 bonus to all saving
throws against illusions.

Speak with Earth Elementals
Svirfneblins can speak with natives of the
plane of elemental earth.

Advancement
Experience

Level Titles

All characters who make it through an
adventure alive receive experience points
(XP), awarded by the referee. XP is
gained from two sources: treasure recovered and monsters defeated.

In some campaigns, characters gain the
right to bear certain titles as they advance
in level. Such titles may be granted by
the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs
are associates of. Level titles often vary
greatly between campaign worlds, but the
following lists may be used as inspiration:
▶ Acrobat: Apprentice, Tumbler, Jumper, Gymnast, Vaulter, Leaper, Aerialist,
Acrobat, Master Acrobat.
▶ Assassin: Bravo, Rutterkin, Waghalter,
Murderer, Thug, Killer, Cutthroat, Executioner, Assassin.
▶ Barbarian: Hunter, Huntsmaster
(Huntsmistress), Barbarian Warrior,
Barbarian Hero, Berserker, Barbarian
Champion, Horde Master (Mistress),
Conqueror, Barbarian Lord (Lady).
▶ Bard: Rhymer, Lyricist, Sonnateer,
Skald, Troubadour, Minstrel, Muse,
Lorist, Bard.
▶ Cleric: Acolyte, Adept, Priest(ess),
Vicar, Curate, Elder, Bishop, Lama, Patriarch (Matriarch).
▶ Drow: Acolyte/Veteran, Adept/Warrior, Priest(ess)/Swordmaster, Vicar/Hero,
Curate/Swashbuckler, Elder/Myrmidon,
Bishop/Champion, Lama/Superhero,
Patriarch (Matriarch)/Lord (Lady).
▶ Druid: Aspirant, Ovate, Initiate of the
1st Circle, Initiate of the 2nd Circle, Initiate of the 3rd Circle, Initiate of the 4th
Circle, Initiate of the 5th Circle, Initiate
of the 6th Circle, Druid.

Prime Requisite Modifiers
Characters receive an XP bonus or
penalty based on their score in their
class’ prime requisites (see Ability Scores,
p20). This modifier is applied to the
grand total XP a particular character
receives at the end of an adventure.

Levelling Up
When a character gains enough XP to
reach the next experience level, the player
should consult the description of the
character’s class and note any improvements in saving throws, attack probabilities, spells per day, and other class abilities. If the character’s Hit Dice increase, a
new Hit Die of the specified type should
be rolled and the result added to the
character’s maximum hit point total.

Maximum XP in One Session
Characters cannot advance more than
one level in one session. Any additional
XP that would take a character two or
more levels above their current level are
lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below
the total for the next level.

Wealth

Money

Successful characters accumulate wealth
from the spoils of their adventures. Treasure may take many forms, but often the
most useful form of treasure is money.

The most common coin is the gold piece
(gp). Coins made of other metals—platinum (pp), electrum (ep), silver (sp), and
copper (cp)—are also used. The conversion rates of coins are shown above.

Starting Money
PCs start with 3d6 × 10 gold pieces.

Inheritance
Faced with the possibility of character
death, players may wish to create a will
for their characters, to leave wealth behind for an heir. If the referee allows this,
the following stipulations apply:
▶ Tax: Any treasure left as an inheritance
will be taxed at 10%.
▶ Heir: A character’s heir must be a new
1st level character.
▶ Once only: A player may only leave a
character inheritance once.

Domains
When characters have amassed sufficient
wealth, they will often wish to construct
a base or stronghold and possibly found
a domain.
See Strongholds, p118 for full rules on
building a stronghold and founding a
domain.

items not on these lists, the referee may
use the listed items as guidelines for
determining the prices and characteristics of new items, including combat
statistics (if appropriate).
Tinder box: Used to light fires, including
torches. Using a tinder box takes one
round. There is a 2-in-6 chance of success
per round.
Torch: A torch burns for 1 hour (6 turns),
clearly illuminating a 30’ radius. Torches
may also be used in combat (see Weapon
Combat Stats, p97).

target with the liquid. The listed damage
is inflicted for two rounds, as the liquid
drips off.
Two-handed: Requires both hands; the
character cannot use a shield.
97

Poison
At the referee’s option, various types of
poison may be available for purchase.
Using poison is a chaotic act, so it will be
avoided by many characters. The sale of
poisons is also prohibited by most cultures. Characters may have to turn to the
black market or to clandestine guilds (e.g.
of thieves or assassins) to acquire poison.

Effects of Poison
A victim of a poison attack must save
versus poison with a modifier depending
on the strength of the poison. The effects
of the poison then depend on whether
the save succeeded or failed.
The tables opposite list the available types
of poison, the cost to purchase a single
vial, and the following details:
▶ Save modifier: Applied to the victim’s
saving throw. Indicative of the strength of
the poison.
▶ Chance of detection: Probability of
the victim noticing the poison, either
visually (per round of a poisoned blade
being used) or by smell or taste. Characters who notice a poisoned blade may
attack the one wielding it or may call for
aid. A victim who notices an ingested
poison will reject the poisoned drink or
food, thus avoiding being poisoned.
▶ Onset time: The poison’s effect occurs
after this delay. An onset time of “instant”
indicates that the poison takes effect
instantly, before the victim has a chance
to react in any way.
▶ Effect (if save succeeds / fails): Notes
what happens to victim if the saving
throw fails or succeeds.

98

Using Bloodstream Poisons
Bloodstream poisons are typically applied
to a bladed weapon.

Application

Applying a vial of poison to a weapon
takes one turn. A vial of poison is sufficient for a single bladed melee weapon or
up to 6 arrows or crossbow bolts.

Effectiveness

Once applied to a blade, a poison is
effective for up to two days or two hits in
combat, whichever comes first.
Evaporation over time: After one day, a
poison is at half effectiveness; after two
days it is no longer effective.
Wiping off after hits: A poison has full
effectiveness on the first successful attack.
On the second successful attack, it has
half effectiveness, and upon subsequent
attacks the poison is no longer effective.
Half effectiveness: A poison at half
effectiveness inflicts only half damage.
For poisons that cause death (rather than
damage), half effectiveness grants a +4
bonus to the saving throw.

Using Ingested Poisons
Ingested poisons take effect when swallowed by the victim. A vial of poison is
enough to poison one victim.

Vehicles and Animals
Rules For Vehicles

the referee may rule that cargo hold space
could be converted into additional living
quarters.

Game Statistics

Seaworthiness

Hull Points (hp)

The vehicle’s structural integrity and ability to keep moving when damaged. Analogous to a character’s hit points. A vehicle
that reaches 0 hull points is destroyed.

Armour Class (AC)

The vehicle’s ability to resist damage from
attacks.

Movement Rate

The speed at which the vehicle can move.
Every vehicle has a base movement
rate and an encounter movement rate
(noted in parentheses). The encounter
movement rate is one third of the base
movement rate.

Cargo Capacity

The maximum load the vehicle can carry,
measured in coins (see Time, Weight,
and Movement, p214).

Required Crew

The number of people or animals (e.g.
sailors, oarsmen, horses) required for the
vehicle’s normal operation.

Passengers or Mercenaries

Some vehicles have extra space aboard
specifically intended to carry passengers
or mercenaries (of any type, see Mercenaries, p112) in addition to the normal
crew. If a vehicle’s description does not
mention this space for passengers, it is assumed to only have space for the crew—
100

Water vessels are divided into two categories, each behaving differently under
different wind conditions (see Wind
Conditions, p227). Seaworthy vessels
are suitable for use on the high seas, away
from coastal waters. Unseaworthy vessels
are restricted to rivers, lakes, or coastal
waters.

Damaging Vehicles
In combat, attacks and damage may be
directed at vehicles in addition to characters and monsters.
Normal attacks: Unless noted in a
vehicle’s description, attacks with normal
weapons (e.g. bows, swords, etc.) do not
inflict hull damage.
Magical attacks: Damaging spells or
magical attacks inflict one point of hull
damage per five points of normal hit
point damage the attack does.
Giant monsters: Can damage vehicles,
inflicting one point of hull damage per
five points of normal hit point damage
the attack does.
Mounted weaponry: Some vehicles carry
mounted weaponry specifically designed
for vehicle-to-vehicle combat. Such weapons inflict hull damage directly. The rules
for attacking with ship-mounted weapons
are described in Water Vessels, p106.

Effects of Hull Damage

Boarding

When a vehicle loses hull points, its
movement rate is also affected. This may
be due to structural damage influencing
how the vehicle moves or, in the case of
water vessels, due to taking on water.
Movement rate reduction: For every
10% a vehicle is reduced from its maximum hull points, its movement rate
is reduced by an equal percentage. For
example, if a vehicle loses 20% of its hull
points, its movement rate is reduced by
20%.

When the occupants of a vehicle wish to
board another vehicle, the two vehicles
must be brought alongside one another.
Forceful boarding: If the occupants of
one vehicle wish to forcefully board the
other vehicle, there is a 2-in-6 chance of
being able to successfully manoeuvre the
vehicle into a boarding position. The two
vehicles may then be clamped together
with grappling hooks.
Mutual boarding intent: If the occupants
of both vehicles wish to board one another, their mutual intent makes the action
succeed with no chance of failure.
Boarding characters: Characters who
are in the act of boarding another vehicle
suffer a –2 penalty to attack rolls and
Armour Class for one round.

Destruction

If a vehicle is reduced to 0 hull points:
▶ It will lose its structural integrity in
1d10 rounds (e.g. a water vessel sinks).
▶ Any mounted weaponry is no longer
functional.

Repairs

In a workshop: Vehicle damage can be
repaired by experienced technicians
working in a suitable workshop or dock.
In the field: A vehicle’s crew can repair
up to half of any damage sustained. Remaining damage can only be repaired in
a suitable workshop or dock.
Time: It takes five crew-members one
turn to repair one hull point. This task requires full attention, so any crew involved
in repair cannot take any other action
during a turn repairing a vessel.

Rowed Water Vessels
Rowing Encounter Speeds

Some rowed vessels may have an increased encounter movement rate. This
represents the great effort on the part of
the oarsmen that may be exerted during
combat. Such speeds cannot be maintained for long periods, thus the per turn
and per day movement rates of such
vessels are much slower.

Reduced Oarsmen

Having less than the required number of
oarsmen reduces a vessel’s speed.
Movement rate reduction: For every
10% reduction in the available rowing
crew, the vessel’s rowing speed is reduced
by an equal percentage. For example, if
10% of the oarsmen are being used to
repair hull damage, the vessel moves at
90% of its normal speed (i.e. 10% slower
than normal).

Lifeboat: A small boat with a mast that
folds down for storage. A small ship usually has 1–2 lifeboats, while larger ships
may have 3–4. A lifeboat weighs 5,000
coins and reduces the cargo capacity of
the ship on which it is carried by this
much. A lifeboat is usually equipped with
rations to feed ten human-sized beings
for one week.
Longship: A narrow ship which may be
used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open
seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed,
depending on the conditions. The crew
typically fill the role of oarsmen, sailors,
and fighters, as needed.
Sailing ship, large: A large, seaworthy
vessel with up to three masts. Usually has
multiple decks and raised “castles” at the
bow and stern.

Descriptions
Boat, river: Riverboats are either rowed
or pushed with poles. The cost of the boat
increases by 1,000gp if it has a roof (to
protect passengers or cargo).
Boat, sailing: A small boat typically used
for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.
Canoe: A small boat made of hide or
canvas stretched over a wooden frame.
Because of its small size and lightweight
construction, a canoe may be carried by
two people (weighing 500 coins).
Galley, large: A long ship with a shallow
draft and a single, square-sailed mast.
Galley, small: A ship with a shallow draft
and a single, square-sailed mast.

Vessel Dimensions

Galley, war: A large, specially constructed galley that is generally a fleet’s flagship.
War galleys are always fitted with a ram
(comes with the basic cost) and have a
full deck above the rowers. They have two
masts and 10’–20’ wide wooden towers
rising 15’–20’ above the bow and stern.
Raft, makeshift: Given sufficient wood,
characters may build a makeshift raft in
1–3 days per 10’ square section (up to a
maximum size of 20’ × 30’).
Raft, professional: A professionally built
raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar,
and some form of shelter for goods or
passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30’ ×
40’. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and
then broken down and sold for the value
of their wood (25cp per square foot).

A ship’s beam is its width and its draft is
the depth it extends beneath the water.

Crew

Rams

Vessels are propelled by rowing or sailing,
with some able to use either means. The
necessary crew and the resulting speeds
are given in the table above. The pay rates
for crew are listed in Specialists, p114.

Can be used against ships or giant sea
monsters. Small individuals cannot be
targeted.
Attack rolls: Are made using a THAC0 of
19 [0] and occur at the same point in the
combat sequence as missile fire.
Attack modifiers: May be applied for
weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc.
Large or war galley: Deals 1d6+5 × 10
hull points damage against ships and 6d6
hit points damage against monsters.
Small galley: Deals 1d4+4 × 10 hull
points damage against ships and 3d8 hit
points damage against monsters.

Ship Modifications
The following modifications may be
made to an existing ship:
▶ Warship: A sailing ship may be converted into a warship or troop transport
of the same size. The modification costs
one-third of the ship’s original cost.
▶ Catapult: A catapult may be added to
a galley, longship, or warship.
▶ Ram: A ram may be added to a large
or small galley (a war galley already
comes with a ram fitted).

Catapults
Fire either large rocks or flaming pitch.
Weight: A catapult plus twenty rounds
of shot weighs 10,000 coins (subtracted
from the ship’s cargo allowance).
Range: 150–300 yards.
Attack rolls and rate of fire: Depend
on the number of crew manning the
catapult:
▶ 2 crew (minimum): Attacks with
THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 10 rounds.
▶ 3 crew: Attacks with THAC0 19 [0].
Fires every 8 rounds.
▶ 4 crew (maximum): Attacks with
THAC0 17 [+2]. Fires every 5 rounds.
Attack modifiers: May be applied for
weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc.

Catapult Shot

Inflicts 3d6 hull damage against ships.

Catapult Shot, Pitch

Sets a 10’×10’ area of a ship on fire. The
burning does 1d6 hull points of damage
per turn (for at least one turn) and will
spread to other areas of the ship if not
extinguished. A fire may be put out by
five crew in 3 turns, ten crew in 2 turns,
or fifteen crew in 1 turn.

Hired Help
Retainers
Retainers are NPCs that are hired by
characters to accompany them on an
adventure.
Limit per PC: Each character is limited
to a finite number of retainers, as indicated by the character’s Charisma score (see
Ability Scores, p20).
Duties: Retainers are not mindless slaves
and, although they will usually share the
party’s risks, they will not willingly act as
battle fodder. If abused in any way, retainers will typically warn others of this and
the PCs will soon find it difficult to hire
other retainers.

Class and Level
Retainers can be of any class (including
normal humans—effectively of level 0),
but must be of equal or lower level to the
hiring PC.

Recruitment
Potential retainers may be located by frequenting drinking establishments or by
paying to post notices of help wanted.
Applicants are recruited through negotiation, with the referee playing the
roles of the NPCs a character attempts to
hire. The PC should explain what the job
entails and the wages paid.

110

Wages and Upkeep
The referee should determine the rate of
pay desired by potential retainers, taking
the following factors into account:
▶ Skill level: More experienced retainers
will want a higher rate of pay, whereas
those employed for unskilled tasks will
have lower demands.
▶ Competition: Retainers may accept
lower rates of pay if there are many applicants, but may demand higher rates if
there is little competition for the job.

Standard Rate

Retainers will usually want a guaranteed
fee (per day or per adventure) and a share
of treasure recovered (at very least a half
share). For example: a fee of 1gp per day
plus a half share of treasure.

Upkeep

The hiring PC must also pay for the
retainer’s daily upkeep (food and lodgings) and for any new adventuring gear,
weapons, or mounts the retainer requires.

Shares of Treasure
Fractional shares of treasure are calculated by dividing the treasure by the
total number of shares. For example, a
party consisting of 5 PCs (who receive
full shares) plus one retainer (who is
paid a half share) discover 2,750gp of
treasure. The total is divided by 5.5 (five
full shares plus one half share): 500gp.
Thus, each PC gains 500gp and the
retainer gains 250gp.

Applicant Reactions

Experience

Once an offer is made, the referee determines the potential retainer’s reaction by
rolling 2d6 on the table below, modified
as follows:
▶ Charisma: The roll is modified by the
hiring character’s reaction modifier due
to CHA (see Ability Scores, p20).
▶ Generosity: The referee may apply
a bonus or penalty, depending on the
attractiveness of the deal (+1 or +2 for
generous offers, –1 or –2 for poor offers).
▶ Reputation: A penalty of –1 or –2
may be applied, if the hiring PC has a bad
reputation.

Although retainers are played by the
referee, they acquire experience in the
same way PCs do, can advance in level,
and are affected by all of the same class
rules as PCs.
XP penalty: Because retainers follow
instructions when on an adventure, thus
not directly engaging in problem solving,
XP they receive is penalised by –50%.
Normal humans: When a normal human
(i.e. a retainer of level 0 with no character class) gains XP, they must choose an
adventuring character class.

Ill will

Ill will: A –1 penalty applies to further
hiring reaction rolls while recruiting in
the same town or area.

Loyalty
Retainers have a loyalty rating, determined by the hiring character’s CHA (see
Ability Scores, p20). This rating may
be adjusted at the referee’s discretion:
▶ Bonuses: A retainer’s loyalty may be
increased if the PC has been particularly
good to the retainer (e.g. has repeatedly
given additional treasure).
▶ Penalties: A retainer’s loyalty may
be reduced if the PC has been cruel or
contrary to their word.

Loyalty Checks
To make a loyalty check, the referee
rolls 2d6 and, if the result is lower than
or equal to the retainer’s loyalty rating,
accounting for any adjustments, the roll
has succeeded.

When to Check Loyalty
Loyalty checks are made in two circumstances:
▶ Peril: Each time the retainer is exposed to a particularly perilous situation.
If the roll fails, the retainer will likely flee.
▶ After an adventure: If the roll fails, the
retainer will not work for the PC again.
111

Mercenaries
Hired soldiers who will guard, patrol, and
otherwise serve in wilderness settings,
but only as part of a larger force, not an
adventuring party. Mercenaries do not
accompany characters on adventures.
Note that as mercenaries are hired by a
character to perform specific services,
they are not treated as retainers and thus
do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.

112

Locating Mercenaries
Mercenaries can be located by posting
notices of help wanted. The response will
depend on the availability of suitable
troops in the area and the offer made.

Wages
Outside of wartime: As listed opposite.
During wartime: All wages are doubled.

Upkeep
The monthly rate of pay includes food
and basic gear. Most mercenaries already
have weapons and armour when hired,
though their employer may give them
additional gear. Note that armourers are
required to repair mercenaries’ armour
and weapons (see Specialists, p114).

Specialists
All types of characters that PCs may wish
to hire for non-combat and non-adventuring purposes (i.e. not mercenaries or
retainers) are termed specialists.
Note that as specialists are hired by a
character to perform specific services,
they are not treated as retainers and thus
do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.
The most common types of specialists
are described, along with their typical
monthly pay rates. This list is not exhaustive and the referee may create additional
types of specialists as needed.

Alchemist
Recreating potions: Based on a sample
or recipe, an alchemist can produce a
potion at twice the normal speed and
for half the normal cost (see Magical
Research, p126).
Researching potions: An alchemist may
also research new potions, but this takes
twice as long and costs twice as much as
normal.

Locating Specialists
Specialists can be located by posting
notices of help wanted. The response will
depend on the availability of suitable specialists in the area and the offer made.

Wages and Upkeep
The monthly rate of pay includes food
and basic gear.

Animal Trainer
Trainers are not required for small
numbers of common animals like dogs,
horses, or mules, but more exotic animals
or larger numbers of normal animals
require a specialised trainer.
Speciality: All animal trainers are specialised in a particular kind of animal.
Number of animals: A trainer can have
up to six animals under their care at a
time.
Time required: The referee decides how
long an animal must be trained, based on
the nature of the training. It will take a
minimum of one month to teach an animal the first new behaviour or trick. After
this first month, an animal has become
accustomed to the trainer and can be
taught additional behaviours at twice the
rate (two weeks per behaviour).
Interruptions: If training is interrupted,
all time already spent on that particular
behaviour is lost and the animal becomes
unable to learn further behaviours.

Armourer

Oarsman

Producing weapons and armour: Per
month, an armourer can make five weapons, three shields, or one suit of armour.
Maintaining mercenaries’ gear: A dedicated armourer is required per 50 troops.
Assistants: An armourer’s output (either
in terms of arms produced or troops
maintained) may be doubled by hiring
two assistant armourers and one blacksmith. If four assistants and two blacksmiths are hired, the armourer’s output
may be quadrupled. An armourer cannot
coordinate more assistants than this.

Unskilled normal humans who man the
oars of sea vessels. Not trained for combat.

Assistant Armourer
Apprentices who may work under an
armourer to increase the rate of production. See Armourer.

Blacksmith
Craftsmen trained in the art of forging
metal. Blacksmiths may be hired to work
under an armourer to increase the rate of
production. See Armourer.

Engineer
Engineers plan and oversee large construction projects such as building
strongholds (see Strongholds, p118).
Number required: One engineer is needed per 100,000gp cost of the project.
Speciality: Humans usually handle overground structures, while dwarves may be
hired for underground construction.

Navigator
A navigator is a sailor who understands
how to read charts and navigate based on
instruments and the position of the stars.
Any time a ship ventures beyond sight of
a coastline, it becomes lost if a navigator
is not aboard. (See Waterborne Adventuring, p226.)

Sage
Sages are very rare individuals who
devote their lives to the study of obscure
knowledge. A sage may be consulted to
answer unusual questions.
Time and cost: The referee must judge
the time and cost required to research the
answer to a question.
Chance of success: There is never a 100%
chance of success in finding an answer.

Sailor
Skilled normal humans who can handle a
ship. Sailors can fight to defend their ship,
typically being equipped with a sword,
shield, and leather armour.

Ship’s Captain
A captain is required for any large ship,
is skilled like a sailor, and has an intimate
knowledge of the particular coasts they
frequent.

Spy
A spy is hired to gather information
about a person or group. The spy may be
an outsider who tries to infiltrate or may
be a traitor already connected with the
person or group to be spied upon.
Class: Spies are often NPC thieves, but
may be of any character class.
Time: The referee will determine the time
required for the job.
Chance of success: The referee judges
the probability of success in the mission,
based on the circumstances.
Reliability: Spies may or may not be reliable and could stab the hiring character
in the back (perhaps literally!).
115

116

117

Strongholds
Construction
When PCs wish to construct strongholds
or any other type of building, the following procedure should be used:
1. Permission: It may be necessary to
secure permission to build from an
existing authority over the land. This
may not be required if the land is
uncharted wilderness.
2. Clear land: If the construction site
is in the wilderness, all monsters in a
6-mile area (i.e. one hex on a typical
small-scale wilderness map) must be
killed or driven off.
3. Design: The player creates a plan for
the stronghold and calculates the costs
(see construction prices overleaf).
4. Review: The referee should review and
approve the player’s plans.
5. Hire engineers: For every 100,000gp
cost of the stronghold, the PC must
hire one engineer (see Specialists,
p114).
6. Construction: Once the land has been
cleared and construction materials delivered, construction may commence.
The time required depends entirely on
the stronghold’s total price: one day of
game time per 500gp.
7. Prepare for settlers: If the PC wishes
to found a dominion and attract settlers, a wider area around the stronghold should be cleared of dangers.

118

Building in Towns
Permission: While local rulers may allow
PCs to build in a town, it is unlikely that
they will grant permission for the construction of castles or fortifications.
Costs: When building in an existing town
or city, the proximity of materials and
labour greatly reduce the costs.
▶ Stone buildings: Reduced by 60%.
▶ Wooden buildings: Reduced by 80%.

Domain
Management
Maintaining Cleared Lands
To prevent monsters from returning to
cleared lands, mercenaries may be hired
to conduct patrols. These patrols can cover a maximum radius of 18 miles around
a stronghold (6 miles, in inhospitable
terrain such as swamp, mountains, or
thick jungle). If the area to be maintained
is larger, additional garrisons must be
stationed at intervals.

Settlers
The PC may wish to attract settlers into a
cleared area. In addition to ensuring the
safety of surrounding lands, the character
will have to fund construction of other
buildings (e.g. accommodation, commercial facilities, transport infrastructure,
etc.) to attract settlers. Advertising may
also be necessary. The referee will determine the costs involved and how many
settlers are attracted.

Taxation
If settlers move into the PC’s domain, the
character can expect to gain 10gp of taxes
per year from each settler.

against a castle wall. 30’ base, 30’ high,
walls 5’ thick.
Civilian building, stone: Two levels;
wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof;
attic. Outer wall 120’ long (e.g. 30’×30’),
walls 1–2’ thick.
Civilian building, wood: Two levels;
wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof;
attic. Outer wall 120’ long (e.g. 30’×30’).
Drawbridge: Raisable wooden bridge
crossing a moat. May be attached to a
gatehouse. 10’ long.
Gatehouse: Fortified entry/exit point in a
castle wall. Includes a portcullis. 30’×30’
base, 20’ high, walls 5’ thick.
Keep: Fortified, central building of a castle. 60’ square, 80’ high, walls 10’ thick.
Moat: Defensive ditch, often filled with
water. 100’ long, 20’ wide, 10’ deep.
120

Subterranean passage: Typical
10’×10’×10’ dungeon passageway.

Non-Standard Dimensions
Bastions

Bastions of dimensions other than those
listed may be constructed. Use the guidelines for towers, below, and divide by two.

Castle Walls

Higher castle walls may be constructed at
increased cost. A 100’ length of 30’ high
wall costs 7,500gp. Every additional 10’ of
height beyond this (up to a maximum of
60’ high) costs 5,000gp.

Towers

Towers of dimensions other than those
listed may be constructed. The cost is determined by the height of the tower and
the diameter of its base (in feet).
▶ Maximum height: Twice the base
diameter.
▶ Up to the base diameter: Each 10’ of
height costs 200gp × the base diameter.
▶ Above the base diameter: Each 10’ of
height costs 400gp × the base diameter.

Example Tower Cost Calculation

A 60’ high tower with a 40’ diameter
base is to be constructed.
The cost will be 8,000gp (40 × 200gp)
per 10’ for the first 40’ of height and
16,000gp (40 × 400gp) per 10’ for the
remainder of the height.
The total cost is thus (8,000gp × 4) +
(16,000gp × 2) = 64,000gp.

Interior Features
The common interior features of a
stronghold are listed in the table below.

Simple Approach

For simplicity, the cost of a stronghold
may be increased by 25% to account for
interior details, including: reinforced
doors, stone stairs, flagstone flooring,

tile roofing, windows or arrow slits, bars
and shutters on windows, and standard
furnishings.

Detailed Approach

If the group wishes to perform more
detailed calculations or if additional

Magic
Spells
Some character classes have the ability to
memorize and cast magical spells. A spell
consists of a pattern of magical energy
memorized in a character’s mind. When
a spell is cast, the spell is erased from the
character’s mind until it is memorized
again.
Arcane and divine magic: Spells are
either granted by a deity or higher power
(divine magic) or learned by esoteric
study (arcane magic).
Spell list: The character’s class determines which spells they can cast. Each
class has an associated list of spells.
Spells in memory: The character’s level
determines how many spells they can
memorize at one time.
Reversible spells: Some spells are reversible; this is indicated in each spell’s
description.

Memorizing Spells
Rest and time requirements: A spell
caster can memorize new spells after an
uninterrupted night’s sleep. It takes one
hour to memorize all spells the character
is capable of memorizing.
Duplicate spells: A character may memorize the same spell more than once, as
long as they are capable of memorizing
more than one spell of the given level.

122

Casting Spells
A memorized spell may be cast by precisely replicating the required set of hand
gestures and mystical spoken words.
Once only: When a spell is cast, knowledge of the spell is erased from the mind
of the caster until it is memorized again.
Freedom: The character must be able
to speak and move their hands. A spell
caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound,
or in an area of magical silence.
Line of sight: Unless noted in a spell’s
description, the intended target (a specific monster, character, object, or area of
effect) must be visible to the caster.

Spell Effects
Selecting targets: Some spells affect
multiple targets, either by area or by Hit
Dice total. If the spell description does
not specify how targets are selected, the
referee must decide whether they are
selected randomly, by the caster, etc.
Concentration: Some spells specify that
the caster must concentrate in order
to maintain the magical effect. Unless
the spell description states otherwise,
performing any other action or being
distracted (e.g. attacked) causes concentration to end.
Cumulative effects: Multiple spells cannot be used to increase the same ability
(e.g. bonuses to attack rolls, AC, damage
rolls, saving throws, etc.). Spells that
affect different abilities can be combined.
Spells can be combined with the effects of
magical items.

Arcane Magic
Memorizing Spells

Arcane spell casters memorize spells
from spell books (see overleaf) and are
thus limited to choosing from the spells
in their spell book, which must be at
hand.

Reversing Spells

The normal or reversed form of a spell
must be selected when the spell is memorized. An arcane spell caster may memorize both forms of a spell if the character
is able to memorize more than one spell
of the given level.

Divine Magic
Memorizing Spells

Divine spell casters memorize spells
through prayer to their gods. When
praying for spells, divine spell casters may
choose any spells in their class’ spell list
that they are of high enough level to cast.

Reversing Spells

Divine spell casters can cast the reversed
version of a spell by speaking the words
and performing the gestures backwards
when it is cast.

Deity Disfavour

Divine spell casters must be faithful to
the tenets of their alignment, clergy, and
religion. If the character ever falls from
favour with their deity, penalties (determined by the referee) may be imposed.
These may include penalties to attack
(–1), a reduction in spells, or being sent
on a perilous quest. In order to regain
favour, the character must perform some
great deed for their deity (as determined
by the referee), for example: donating
magic items or gold, constructing a
temple, converting many people to the
religion, vanquishing a powerful enemy
of the deity, etc.

Spells and Deity Alignment

A divine spell caster may draw disfavour
from their deity when casting spells (or
their reversed versions) whose effects go
against the deity’s alignment:
▶ Lawful characters: Will only use reversed spells in dire circumstances.
▶ Chaotic characters: Will usually use
reversed spells, only using the normal
versions of spells to benefit allies of their
religion.
▶ Neutral characters: Will favour either
normal or reversed spells, depending on
the deity served (no deity favours both
reversed and normal spells).

Turning the Undead
Some divine spell casters have the ability
to turn the undead, with the chance of
success noted in their character class
description. Unless noted in the character class description, turning the undead
may be attempted without limit.

Limits on Turning the Undead
(Optional Rule)
Groups who wish to impose limits on
turning the undead may use the following guidelines:
▶ Frequency: Each character capable
of turning the undead may make one
attempt per encounter.
▶ Mixed groups of undead: In encounters with multiple types of undead, a
character who makes a successful turning
attempt may optionally make another
attempt in the following round. This
process may be repeated until all types of
undead have been affected or a turning
attempt fails.
▶ Duration: A successfully turned monster is affected for 1 turn. Following this
turn, the monster may return.
123

Spell Books
Arcane spell casters record the spells that
they know in a spell book. Two different
sets of rules for handling spell books are
presented here—standard rules which
limit the number of spells a character
may have in their spell book and advanced rules which allow arcane spell
casters a much wider range of spells. The
referee should decide which rules to use.

Standard Spell Book Rules
Number of Spells

A character’s spell book contains exactly
the number of spells that the character is
capable of memorizing (as determined by
the character’s class and level).

Beginning Spells

Arcane spell casters begin play with as
many spells in their spell book as they
are able to memorize. The referee may
choose these spells or may allow the
player to select.

Adding Spells

When the number of spells an arcane
spell caster can memorize increases (e.g.
by gaining an experience level), they can
increase the selection of spells in their
spell book. In this way, the number of
spells in the spell book may be brought
in line with the number of spells the
character can memorize. This is possible
in two ways:
▶ Mentoring: The character may consult
an arcane guild or mentor to learn new
spells. This process takes about a week of
game time. The spells a character learns
in this way are determined by the referee,
who may decide to let the player choose.
▶ Research: It is also possible to add
spells to a spell book by means of magical
research (see p126).
124

Advanced Spell Book Rules
(Optional Rule)
Number of Spells

There is no limit to the number of spells
in the character’s spell book.

Beginning Spells

Arcane spell casters begin play with a
number of spells in their spell book determined by their INT score (see the table
below). The referee may choose these
spells or may allow the player to select.

Adding Spells

An arcane spell caster may attempt to add
spells to their spell book at any time, as
follows:
▶ Copying: Spells of a level which the
character can cast may be copied from
another source, for example scrolls or the
spell books of another spell caster. The
chance of success depends on the copying character’s INT score (see the table
below). If the roll fails, the character can
never learn the spell.
▶ Research: It is also possible to add
spells to a spell book by means of magical
research (see p126).

Lost Spell Books
An arcane spell caster can rewrite the
spells in a lost or destroyed spell book:
▶ Cost: The cost per spell to be recovered is 1 week of game time and 1,000gp
per level of the spell. For instance, rewriting two first level spells and one 2nd level
spell will take 4 weeks and 4,000gp.

▶ Sole activity: This activity requires
complete concentration. The character
may not engage in any other activity for
the required period.

Captured Spell Books
Each arcane spell caster’s spell books are
written so that only the owner is able to
read the spells without the use of magic.

125

Magical Research
Many spell casting character classes can
also perform research into new spells,
magic items, and other magical effects,
as noted in the class description. This
requires time, monetary outlay, and
sometimes rare and unusual ingredients.
Success in any magical research is not
guaranteed—see Chance of Failure.

Creating New Spells
The player should describe in detail the
spell they wish to create and the effects
it has. The referee will then decide if the
spell can be created and, if so, what the
spell level will be.

Restrictions

The character must be capable of casting
spells of the level the new spell will be.

Cost and Time

Researching a new spell takes two weeks
per spell level and 1,000gp per spell level.

126

Creating Magic Items
The player should describe in detail the
item that they wish to construct and
the effects it has. The referee will decide
whether this is possible and, if so, what
kinds of materials are required.

Restrictions

Divine spell casters: May only create
items that they are able to use themselves.
Arcane spell casters: May create any item
except those that may only be used by
divine spell casters.

Materials

Creating magic items often requires rare
components such as expensive gems or
ingredients from rare animals or monsters. Often, adventures will be required
just to acquire these materials.

Cost and Time

Duplicating spell effects: Many magic
items duplicate the effects of a spell, generally costing one week of game time and
500gp per level of the mimicked spell.
Multi-use items: If the item created can
replicate a spell effect multiple times (for
example a wand with charges), the cost
in time and money is multiplied by the
number of uses.
Other items: Some magic items do not
mimic spell effects precisely and for these
the referee will have to use discretion. The
more powerful the item, the more difficult it should be to construct. As a general rule, items should cost from 10,000 to
100,000gp and from 1 month to 1 year of
game time to complete. Some examples:
20 arrows +1 (10,000gp, 1 month), plate
mail +1 (10,000gp, 6 months), crystal ball
(30,000gp, 6 months), ring of x-ray vision
(100,000gp, 1 year).

Other Magical Research
Characters that are able to research
spells or magic items may also attempt to
research other kinds of magical effects for
which a magic item or spell is not appropriate. For example, a character may wish
to sanctify a holy site or create magical
traps, constructs, or portals.
As with magic item creation, the referee
decides the time and cost of the research.
The following may also be required:
▶ The casting of certain specific spells.
▶ Rare ingredients.
▶ In some cases, it may also be necessary
to periodically repeat the ritual to renew
the magical effect.

Chance of Failure
There is a minimum probability of 15%
that any magical research endeavour
fails. If the research fails, the money and
time invested are lost.

Cleric Spells
1st Level Spells
Cure Light Wounds
Duration: Instant
Range: The caster or a creature touched
This spell has two uses
1. Healing a living subject: Restores
1d6+1 hit points of damage. This
cannot grant more hit points than the
subject’s normal maximum.
2. Curing paralysis: Paralysing effects
are negated.

Reversed: Cause Light Wounds

Inflicts 1d6+1 hit points of damage to
a touched creature. In combat, a melee
attack roll is required.

Detect Evil
Duration: 6 turns
Range: 120’
Objects enchanted for evil purposes or
living beings with evil intentions are
caused to magically glow.
▶ Intent only: This spell does not grant
the ability to read minds, but only grants
a general sense of evil intent.
▶ Definition of evil: The referee must
decide what is “evil”. Some things that are
potentially harmful, like traps, are not
“evil.”

134

Detect Magic
Duration: 2 turns
Range: 60’
Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures
are caused to glow. Both permanent and
temporary enchantments are revealed.

Light
Duration: 12 turns
Range: 120’
This spell has three usages:
1. Conjuring light: In a 15’ radius. The
magical light is sufficient for reading,
but is not as bright as daylight. The
spell may be cast upon an object, in
which case the light moves with the
object.
2. Blinding a creature: By casting the
spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a
saving throw versus spells, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature
cannot attack.
3. Cancelling darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below).

Reversed: Darkness

Creates a 15’ radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not
infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a
light spell.

Protection from Evil

Remove Fear

Duration: 12 turns
Range: The caster

Duration: 2 turns
Range: The caster or a creature touched

This spell wards the caster from attacks
by creatures of another alignment, as
follows:
▶ Bonuses: The caster gains a +1 bonus
to saving throws against attacks or special
abilities of affected creatures.
▶ Affected creatures’ attacks: Against
the caster are penalised by –1.
▶ Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures: The spell additionally
prevents such creatures from attacking
the caster in melee, though they may still
make ranged attacks. If the caster engages
such a creature in melee, this protection
is broken (the caster still gains the save
and attack bonuses mentioned above).

The creature touched is calmed and
purged of fear. Magically induced fear
may be dispelled, but this requires the
subject to make a saving throw versus
spells. The save is modified by +1 per
level of the caster.

Purify Food and Water
Duration: Permanent
Range: 10’
This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and

▶ Cold-based damage: Is reduced by 1
point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)

part of rituals of purification or consecration, at the referee’s discretion.

Reversed: Blight

Incurs a –1 penalty to morale checks,
attack rolls, and damage rolls of enemies
within a 20’ square area. A save versus
spells is allowed to resist the blight.

Find Traps
Duration: 2 turns
Range: 30’
Trapped objects or areas within range of
the caster glow with a magical blue light.
▶ Magical and mechanical traps: Are
both detected.
▶ No knowledge: About the nature of
the trap or how to deactivate it is granted.
136

This spell causes one or more humans,
demihumans, or human-like monsters
(see Persons in the Advanced Fantasy
Referee’s Tome) to be paralysed if they fail
a saving throw versus spells. It may be
cast in two ways:
1. Against an individual: The target’s
saving throw is penalised by –2.
2. Against a group: 1d4 individuals in
the group are targeted.
Restrictions: Human-like monsters of
greater than 4+1 HD (see Hit point modifiers in the Advanced Fantasy Referee’s
Tome) and undead are not affected.

Know Alignment

Duration: 1d4+1 rounds or turns
Range: 60’

Resist Fire
Duration: 2 turns
Range: 30’
A single creature is bestowed with supernatural resistance to fire, as follows:
▶ Normal heat: Unharmed by non-magical heat or fire.
▶ Save bonus: Gain a +2 bonus to all
saving throws versus fire-based magical
or breath attacks.
▶ Fire-based damage: Is reduced by 1
point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)

Silence 15’ Radius
Duration: 12 turns
Range: 180’
A 15’ radius area is rendered utterly
silent.
▶ Within the area: All sound is stopped.
Conversation and spell casting are impossible.
▶ Noise from outside the area: Can be
heard by those within it.
▶ Casting upon a creature: Silence may
be cast upon a creature, which must
save versus spells. If the save fails, the
15’ radius area of silence moves with the
creature. If the save succeeds, the spell’s
effect remains stationary—the targeted
creature may move out of it.

One or more snakes are rendered
non-hostile, rearing up and swaying to
and fro but not attacking.
▶ HD affected: The spell affects snakes
whose total Hit Dice do not exceed the
caster’s level. For example, a 7th level
caster can affect 7 HD of snakes, which
can equal seven 1 HD snakes, or two 3
HD snakes and one 1 HD snake, or any
other combination.
▶ Duration: When cast on snakes that
are already attacking, the spell lasts for
1d4+1 rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for
1d4+1 turns.

type of animal within range when the
spell is cast.
▶ Type of animal: Ordinary animals or
giant versions of ordinary animals may
be targeted.
▶ Questions: The caster can ask questions of and receive answers from animals
of the chosen kind, although the spell
doesn’t make animals any more friendly
or cooperative than normal (a reaction
roll may be required).
▶ Services: If an animal is friendly
toward the caster, it may perform some
favour or service.

1. Conjuring light: In a 30’ radius.

daylight (creatures that suffer attack
penalties in daylight are affected). The
spell may be cast upon an object, in
which case, the light moves with the
object.
2. Blinding a creature: By casting the
spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a
saving throw versus spells, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling darkness: Continual light
may cancel a continual darkness spell
(see below).

Reversed: Continual Darkness

Creates a 30’ radius area of magical blackness, preventing both normal sight and
infravision. Light sources brought within

Like continual light, it may alternatively
be used to blind creatures or to dispel a
continual light spell.

giant versions of normal animals, but
intelligent animals and fantastic monsters
are unaffected.

Locate Object
Duration: 6 turns
Range: 120’
The caster can sense the direction (but
not distance) of an object. One of two
types of objects may be located:
1. General class: An object of a general
class (e.g. a stairway, an altar, etc.).
In this case, the nearest object of that
type is located.
2. Specific object: A specific object
which the caster can clearly visualise
in all aspects.
Restrictions: This spell cannot be used to

a monster’s save succeeds, it flees the
affected area.
2. Target single monster: Instantly

within range.

Insect Plague
Duration: Concentration (up to 1 day)
Range: 480’

Raise Dead

Duration: Until quest is completed /

Duration: Instant
Range: 120’

The caster commands a single subject to
perform a specific quest or task.
▶ Examples: Rescuing a prisoner, killing
a specific monster, bringing a magic item
to the caster, or going on a journey to a
holy site.
▶ Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest
must not be obviously suicidal.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells, with success indicating that
the quest has no effect.
▶ Refusal: Otherwise, the subject must
undertake the quest or fall under a curse
(per the curse spell, with the exact nature
of the curse determined by the referee).
▶ Completion: Once the task is completed, the spell ends.

Reversed: Remove Quest

Can dispel an active quest spell. If the
character who cast the quest spell to be
nullified is higher level than the character
casting remove quest, there is a chance of
the spell having no effect. The probability of failure is 5% per level the caster is
below the caster of quest.

This spell has two uses:
1. Restore life: To a recently deceased
human or demihuman. See below.
2. Destroy undead: A single undead
monster is destroyed, if it fails a saving
throw versus spells.
Restoring life: When used to restore life,
the following stipulations apply:
▶ Time limit: The caster can raise a person that has been dead for no longer than
four days per level of the caster above 7th.
For example, a 10th level caster can revive
a character that has been dead for twelve
days (three levels above 7th × four days).
▶ Weakness: Returning from death is
an ordeal. Until the subject gets two full
weeks of bed rest, they have 1 hit point,
move at half the normal rate, cannot
carry heavy items, and cannot attack, cast
spells, or use other class abilities. This
period of weakness may not be shortened
by any magical healing.

Reversed: Finger of Death

Directs a ray of deadly magic at a single
target. If the target fails a saving throw
versus death, it dies instantly. Casting
finger of death is a chaotic act; it will only
be used by lawful casters in desperate
situations.

Chromatic Orb Effects

Light: If the target fails a saving throw
versus spells, it is surrounded by light in
a 15’ radius for 1d4 rounds. In low light
conditions, attacks against the target
gain a +2 bonus. Any attempts at stealth
or surprise on the target’s part may be
nullified.
Heat: If the target fails a saving throw
versus spells, it suffers a –2 penalty to
attacks, saves, and AC for 1d4 rounds.
The heat of the ruby orb may also be used
to melt up to a cubic yard of ice.
Fire: All flammable objects within 2’ of
the target are set alight. If the target fails
a saving throw versus spells, flammable
objects (e.g. clothing, hair, etc.) on its
person are also set alight. This inflicts 1d3
damage for 1d4 rounds, unless the target
spends a round extinguishing the flames.
Blindness: The target is blinded for 1d4
rounds unless it saves versus spells. A
blind creature cannot attack.

Stench: A 5’ radius cloud of stinking
vapours erupts at the target’s location.
Creatures within the cloud (including
the target) must save versus poison or be
overcome with nausea—unable to act except to move at half movement rate. Once
leaving the cloud, the nausea subsides
after 1d4 rounds. The cloud disperses
after 1 turn.
Magnetism: The electrical energy of the
orb strongly magnetizes any metal objects
on the target (e.g. armour, weapons) unless a saving throw versus spells is made.
The magnetic charge lasts for 1d4 rounds
and causes metal objects to stick together.
A target wearing metal armour suffers a
–2 penalty to AC and is unable to attack
with metal weapons.
Paralysis: Unless a saving throw versus
paralysis is made, the target is paralysed
for 1d4 rounds.

3. Humanoid: A single, glowing, humanoid form.

160

Glamour
Duration: 2d6 rounds +2 per level
Range: The caster
The caster is wrapped in an illusion, taking on the outward appearance of another
humanoid. Two variants are possible,
chosen as the spell is cast:
1. Imagined form: The caster takes on a
form which they imagine.
2. Duplicate individual: The caster
copies the form of a living individual
whom they touch. An attack roll is
required if the target is unwilling.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Height: The illusionary form may be at
most 1’ taller or shorter than the caster’s
normal form.
▶ Weight: Apparent weight may be
altered in any way.
▶ Gear: Clothing or items may be altered in any way.

another’s appearance, those familiar with
the copied individual may save versus
spells to detect the ruse.

Hypnotism
Duration: 1 round +1 per level
Range: 30’
The caster’s gestures and droning syllables
open the minds of one or more subjects
within range to a hypnotic suggestion
that is uttered as part of the spell casting.
▶ Number of targets: Up to 1d6
creatures are affected. The number of
creatures affected is determined after the
suggestion is made.
▶ Wording: The suggestion must take
the form of a short phrase (at most one
or two sentences) suggesting a course of
action to the subjects.
▶ Comprehension: A language that is
understood by the subjects must be used.
▶ Harmful suggestions: A suggested
course of action that is obviously harmful
to a subject causes the spell to automatically fail for that subject.
▶ Saving throw: Each subject may save
versus spells to resist the hypnotic suggestion. If the save fails, the subject will
follow the caster’s suggestion for up to the
duration of the spell.
▶ Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion
that is worded in such a way to make it
sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.
Restrictions: Undead are not affected by
hypnotism.

Light
Duration: 6 turns +1 per level
Range: 120’
This spell has three usages:
1. Conjuring light: In a 15’ radius. The
magical light is sufficient for reading,
but is not as bright as daylight. The
spell may be cast upon an object, in
which case the light moves with the
object.
2. Blinding a creature: By casting the
spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a
saving throw versus spells, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature
cannot attack.
3. Cancelling darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below).

Reversed: Darkness

Creates a 15’ radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not
infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a
light spell.
161

Phantasmal Force
Duration: Concentration
Range: 240’
A visual illusion of the caster’s choosing
manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types
of illusions may be created:
1. An illusionary monster: That can
be directed to attack. The monster
has AC 9 [10] and vanishes if hit in
combat.
2. An illusionary attack: For example,
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
3. A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new. The
scene disappears if touched.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Concentration: Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves or
loses concentration, the spell ends.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but never inflict
real damage. A character who appears to
die actually falls unconscious, a character
turned to stone will actually be paralysed,
and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

another arcane spell caster can be deciphered.
▶ Inscriptions: Runes or magical words
inscribed on an object or surface can be
understood.
▶ Reading again: Once the caster has
read a magical inscription using read
magic, they are thereafter able to read that
particular writing without recourse to the
use of this spell.

A wall of roiling vapour is conjured at a
location of the caster’s choosing within
range.
▶ Area: The fog fills a 10’ cube area per
level of the caster.
▶ Vision: The fog blocks normal vision
and infravision.
▶ Strong winds: Can clear the fog before
the spell’s duration has expired.

Spook
Duration: Until broken (see below)
Range: 10’
The caster gestures threateningly at an
intelligent target within range.
▶ Saving throw: The target may save
versus spells to avoid coming under the
spell’s effect.

and will flee from the caster at maximum
speed.
▶ Breaking the spell: The target may
make a new save versus spells each
round with success indicating that the
spell is broken. Until the spell is broken,
the target believes it is being pursued by
the imagined horror.
Restrictions: Undead and creatures of
less than animal intelligence are not
affected.
163

2nd Level Spells
Blindness / Deafness
Duration: Permanent
Range: 30’
A single creature is afflicted by a phantasm which nullifies either its visual or
aural sensory input (as selected by the
caster), rendering it blind or deaf.
▶ Saving throw: The target may save
versus spells to avoid the phantasm.
▶ Removing: As the blindness or
deafness caused by this spell is illusory, it
cannot be removed by magic that cures
disease. The affliction may be removed by
spells that dispel magic or illusions.
▶ Cancelling: The caster may cancel the
spell’s effect at will.

Blur
Duration: 1 turn
Range: The caster
The caster’s form becomes blurry and
wavering.
▶ Attack penalties: Creatures attacking
the caster suffer a –4 penalty to hit. This
penalty is reduced to –2 on a creature’s
second or subsequent attempts to hit the
caster.
▶ Save bonus: The caster gains a +1
bonus to saving throws against magic that
directly targets them.

Detect Magic
Duration: 2 turns
Range: 60’
Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures
are caused to glow. Both permanent and
temporary enchantments are revealed.

164

False Aura
Duration: 1 turn
Range: 30’
The aura of a creature or object is veiled.
▶ Detection spells: (e.g. detect magic, detect evil) are deflected, revealing another
creature or object nearby.
▶ Divination spells: (e.g. know alignment) cast upon the subject reveal the
opposite to the truth.

Fascinate
Duration: See below
Range: 30’
This spell causes a single creature to perceive the caster—whatever their normal
appearance—as utterly captivating.
▶ Restrictions: Creatures of less than
animal intelligence are not affected.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells to avoid the effect.
Affected subjects: Behave as follows:
▶ Besotted: The subject follows the caster wherever they go, as if besotted, unless
doing so would present a serious danger.
▶ Obedience: If the caster can communicate with the subject (even if only
by gestures), it may obey requests. Each
time a request is made of the subject, the
caster must make a CHA check (possibly
penalised, if the request is against the
nature or best interests of the subject). If
the check fails, the spell is broken and the
target’s perception of the caster becomes
one of horror, rage, and hate.
▶ Animals: An animal remains fascinated for 1d4 days, after which it may either
attack the caster (if it has been mistreated) or simply leave. If the caster treated
the animal well, there is a percentage
chance equal to the caster’s CHA that
the animal will henceforth remain by the
character’s side of its own free will.

as long as they are able to watch the
pattern.
▶ Number of creatures affected: Up to
24HD of creatures may be hypnotised.
▶ Hypnotised creatures: Simply stand
still, gazing at the pattern of colours.
▶ If a hypnotised creature is harmed:
The pattern ceases to enthral it and it may
act next round.
Concentration: The caster can maintain
the pattern indefinitely as long as they
concentrate on the spell and remain
stationary.

Improved Phantasmal Force
Duration: Concentration
Range: 240’
An illusion of the caster’s choosing—
including minor sounds (though not
speech)—manifests in a 20’ cube area.
Three types of illusions may be created:
1. An illusionary monster: That can be
directed to attack. The monster has an
Armour Class of 7 [12] and will vanish
if hit in combat.
2. An illusionary attack: For example,
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
3. A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new. The
scene disappears if touched.

Stipulations: The following apply:

faster than half speed or loses concentration, the spell ends.
▶ Persistence: Even when the caster
stops concentrating on the spell, the illusion persists for two further rounds.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but never inflict
real damage. A character who appears to
die actually falls unconscious, a character
turned to stone will actually be paralysed,
and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

Invisibility
Duration: Permanent (but may be broken, see below)
Range: 240’
The caster or another creature or object
within range becomes invisible:
▶ If cast on a creature: Any gear the

attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is
broken, ending the spell.
▶ If cast on an object: The invisibility is
permanent.

with a message that is to be spoken out
loud by a magical mouth when a certain
trigger condition occurs.
▶ The message: Must be in a language
the caster speaks and may consist of up to
25 words.
▶ The trigger condition: May be as
broad or as specific as the caster wishes. It
may include conditions on the enchanted
object being touched or on the presence
of creatures within 30’ of the object. The
trigger condition may only take visual
appearances into account (e.g. it cannot
discern the alignment, class, level, etc. of
creatures who pass by).

animates, and speaks the predetermined
message. The enchantment then ends.
▶ Casting spells: The triggered message
cannot cast spells.

form: Are granted to the caster to a limited degree:
▶ Flight: If the new form can fly, the
caster is able to fly at one-quarter of its
flying movement rate.
▶ Breathing: If the new form can breathe
underwater, the caster may also do so.
▶ Attacks: When attacking, the caster
may appear to use the attacks of the new
form but cannot make more attack rolls
or inflict more damage than they are
normally able to (using whatever weapon
is carried).
▶ Special abilities: The caster does
not gain any special or magical attacks
possessed by the new form (e.g. breath
weapons, poison, charm, etc.).

Whispering Wind

This spell allows the caster to send a message or other, non-verbal sound via the
wind to a distant location within range.
▶ The destination: Must be known to
the caster.
▶ The message: Up to 100 words or one
minute of non-verbal sound.
▶ Rate: The message travels on the wind,
unnoticed, at one mile per turn.
▶ Delivery: On reaching the designated
destination, the wind delivers the caster’s
message. The message is whisper quiet,

or not anyone is present to hear it.

167

3rd Level Spells

Range: 60’
Twisting the nature of light and darkness,
this spell creates a 30’ diameter area of
illumination which cannot be perceived
outside of this area.

within the area of blacklight to see in utter
darkness while not revealing their own
presence.

blacklight to manifest either in a designated area within range or about their own
person. (In the latter case, the magical
effect moves with the caster.)

Dispel illusion ends ongoing illusions or
phantasms (i.e. those with a non-instantaneous duration) within a 20’ cube area.

automatically dispelled.
▶ Spells cast by another illusionist:
Have a chance of not being dispelled.
If the level of the caster of the effect to

5% chance per level difference that the
attempt to dispel will fail.
▶ Magic items: Are unaffected.

168

Fear

Conjures a cone of magical energy that
terrifies those within it.

level of the caster. (A save versus spells
negates the effect).

have a 60% chance of immediately dropping anything in their hands. The chance
is decreased by 5% for each level or Hit
Die above 1.

more than 10’ away from the chosen
creature become visible.
▶ Entering the area: Creatures that

also rendered invisible. Items dropped or
put down by an invisible creature become
visible. Carried light sources become
invisible but the emitted light does not.
▶ Breaking the invisibility: If a subject
attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is
broken for that subject.

A number of creatures within a 20’ cube
area are afflicted with the terrifying phantasm of being unable to move.
▶ Number of creatures affected: Up to
2HD of creatures per level of the caster.
▶ Priority: Creatures with the lowest
HD are affected first.
▶ Saving throw: Each target may save
versus spells to resist the phantasm.

Phantom Steed

Rope Trick

Duration: 6 turns per level

▶ 14th level: The steed can fly.

A rope is enchanted to rise up into the
air, enabling the caster and others to
climb it and disappear into an imaginary
space.
▶ The rope: Rises up to its full length (or
at most 30’) and hangs stiffly in the air,
magically tethered at the upper end.
▶ Climbing the rope: The rope may be
climbed normally.
▶ Imaginary space: Human-sized (or
smaller) creatures that climb to the top

Spectral Force

Suggestion

Duration: Concentration
Range: 240’

Duration: 4 turns +4 per level
Range: 30’

An illusion of the caster’s choosing—
including sounds, smells, and thermal
elements—manifests in a 20’ cube area.
Three types of illusions may be created:
1. An illusionary monster: That can
be directed to attack. The monster
has AC 5 [14] and vanishes if hit in
combat.
2. An illusionary attack: For example,
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
3. A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new. The
scene disappears if touched.

The caster utters a suggestion to influence
the behaviour of a selected subject.
▶ Wording: The suggestion must take
the form of a short phrase (at most one
or two sentences) suggesting a course of
action to the subject.
▶ Comprehension: A language that is
understood by the subject must be used.
▶ Harmful suggestions: Suggestions
that are obviously harmful to the subject
cause the spell to automatically fail.
▶ Saving throw: A save versus spells
is allowed to resist the suggestion. If the
save fails, the subject will follow the caster’s suggestion for up to the duration.
▶ Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion
that is worded in such a way to make it
sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.
Restrictions: Undead are unaffected.

Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Concentration: Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves at
faster than half speed or loses concentration, the spell ends.
▶ Persistence: Even when the caster
stops concentrating on the spell, the illusion persists for three further rounds.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but never inflict
real damage. A character who appears to
die actually falls unconscious, a character
turned to stone will actually be paralysed,
and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

Wraithform
Duration: 1 turn
Range: The caster
The caster’s person—along with
everything worn or carried—becomes
shadowy and semi-incorporeal.
▶ Movement: The caster is able to pass
through small holes and cracks.
▶ Actions: The caster may cast spells but
may only attack incorporeal creatures.
▶ Invulnerability: Only magic and incorporeal creatures may harm the caster.
▶ Pass undead: Undead will ignore the
caster, believing them to be a phantom
of some kind. Undead of 10 or more HD
may save versus spells (at a –4 penalty)
to notice the illusion.
▶ Cancelling: The caster may end the
spell at will, returning to normal.
171

4th Level Spells
Confusion

Range: 120’
This spell causes 3d6 subjects within
60’ of one another to become confused,
making them unable to independently
determine what they will do.
▶ Subjects of 2+1 HD or greater: May
save versus spells each round to resist
the spell’s effect, acting with free will that
round if they make the save.
▶ Subjects of 2 HD or lower: May not
make a saving throw.
▶ Behaviour: Roll on the following table
separately for each affected subject each
round to determine how that subject acts
that round:

Dispel Magic
Duration: Instant
Range: 120’
Dispel magic ends spells of non-instantaneous duration within a 20’ cube area.
▶ Caster levels: If the level of the caster
of the effect to be dispelled is higher than
the level of the caster of dispel magic,
there is a 5% chance per level difference
that the attempt to dispel will fail.
▶ Magic items: Are unaffected.

172

Emotion
Duration: Concentration
Range: 10’ per level
All creatures in a 40’ square area within range must save versus spells or be
afflicted by an emotion of the caster’s
choosing:
▶ Fear: Subjects are struck with terror
and will flee from the caster at maximum
speed. Affected creatures have a 60%
chance of immediately dropping anything
in their hands. The chance is decreased
by 5% for each level or Hit Die above 1.
Fear counters ongoing rage effects.
▶ Hate: Subjects gain a +2 bonus to
attacks, damage, saving throws, and morale. Hate counters ongoing hopelessness
effects.
▶ Hopelessness: Subjects are utterly
demoralised and will dejectedly follow
enemies’ orders (e.g. to surrender or
leave). In combat, there is a 1-in-4 chance
of a subject doing nothing each round,
and a 1-in-4 chance of them retreating.
Hopelessness counters ongoing hate
effects.
▶ Rage: Subjects go berserk, gaining a
+1 bonus to hit and +3 to damage. Subjects fight without thought for their own
lives and will not use shields. Subjects
also gain 5 temporary hit points. These
may take a subject above its normal maximum, but disappear when the spell ceases. Rage counters ongoing fear effects.
Concentration: Is required to maintain the projected emotion. If the caster
moves or loses concentration, the spell
ends.

Improved Invisibility
Duration: 4 rounds +1 per level
Range: The caster or a creature touched
The caster or another creature touched
becomes invisible:
▶ Attacking: The subject may attack
while invisible.
▶ Being attacked: Opponents who are
aware of the subject’s presence (but who
cannot see invisible) may detect a faint
shimmering, allowing them to locate the
subject. The subject gains a +4 bonus to
AC and saving throws against attacks
from such opponents.
▶ Equipment: Any gear the subject is
carrying is also rendered invisible (this
includes clothing and armour). Items
dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible.
▶ Light sources: If a light source is made
invisible (as part of the subject’s gear), the
light it casts is unaffected.

Massmorph
Illusory Stamina
Duration: 3 turns per level
Range: Touch
Up to four persons touched by the caster
are refreshed, some of their lost hit points
being temporarily restored.
▶ Bonus hit points: Each subject gains
a number of bonus hit points equal to
50% of the number of hit points they are
currently below maximum. For example,
if the subject has a maximum of 30 hit
points and a current total of 12 hit points,
they gain 9 bonus hit points (50% of 18).
▶ Any damage suffered: Is subtracted
first from the bonus hit points.
▶ When the duration ends: If any of the
bonus hit points remain, they disappear.

Duration: Permanent
Range: 240’
A force of human-sized creatures within
a 240’ diameter area is veiled by illusion
to appear as a copse of trees or orchard.
▶ Moving through: Once the illusion is
in place, even creatures moving among
the veiled subjects are deceived.
▶ Subjects who leave the affected area:
Cease to be veiled.
▶ Dismissing: The caster may dismiss
the illusion in its entirety at any time.

173

Minor Creation

Rainbow Pattern

Duration: 6 turns per level
Range: Touch

Duration: Concentration
Range: 30’ square around the caster

Over the course of one turn, the caster
weaves a semi-real but tangible object
from a tiny piece of constituent matter.
For example, a semi-real rope could be
formed from a strand of hemp fibre.
▶ Non-living: Only objects of non-living vegetable matter may be created (e.g.
fabric, rope, wood, etc.).
▶ Size: The object may be no larger than
one cubic foot per level of the caster.
▶ Food: While it is possible to create
food, its semi-real nature means that it
provides no nourishment.
▶ When the duration ends: The conjured item disappears. The piece of matter
from which it was woven remains.

A band of twisting, interweaving, rainbow colours fills the air in a 30’ × 30’ area
centred on the caster.
▶ Creatures that see the pattern: Must
save versus spells or become hypnotised
as long as they are able to watch the
pattern.
▶ Number of creatures affected: A total
of up to 24 Hit Dice of creatures may be
hypnotised.
▶ Hypnotised creatures: Simply stand
still, gazing at the pattern of colours.
▶ If a hypnotised creature is harmed:
The pattern ceases to enthral it and it may
act next round.
Maintaining the pattern: The pattern
can be maintained and directed as follows:
▶ Concentration: The caster can maintain the pattern indefinitely, as long as
they concentrate on the spell and remain
stationary.
▶ Releasing: The caster may optionally
end concentration and direct the pattern
to drift away in a specified direction. The
pattern drifts at a rate of 30’ per round
and fades after 1d4 rounds. Hypnotised
creatures will do their best to follow the
pattern, but if they are led into a dangerous area, another saving throw versus
spells is allowed to snap out of the trance.

Phantasmal Killer
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 5’ per level
The subconscious fears of a single target
manifest in its mind as a vision of the
most horrible monstrosity it can imagine.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells with a +2 bonus to resist
the phantasm.
▶ Pursuit: The monster pursues the
subject relentlessly and, as it only exists in
the subject’s mind, can move at any speed
and pass through any obstacles.
▶ Invulnerability: The monster is invulnerable to all of the subject’s attacks.
▶ Attacks: The monster attacks the
subject once per round with a THAC0 of
16 [+3]. If one of the monster’s attacks is
successful, the subject dies of terror.
▶ Cancelling: Killing or knocking out
the caster ends the phantasm.
Restrictions: Undead and creatures of less
than animal intelligence are unaffected.
174

Shadow Monsters

Solid Fog

Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 30’

Duration: 1 turn
Range: 60’

The caster conjures one or more semi-real monsters, woven from shadow-stuff.
▶ Hit Dice: The monsters’ total Hit Dice
may not exceed the caster’s level.
▶ Type: All monsters must be of the
same type.
▶ Hit points: The monsters have 1d2 hit
points per Hit Die (instead of the normal
1d8 hit points per Hit Die).
▶ Control: The monsters are under the
caster’s control.
Saving throw: Every creature viewing the
shadow monsters may save versus spells:
▶ If the save succeeds: The subject views
the monsters as they truly are: vague,
shifting forms of shadow. To this subject,
the shadow monsters have AC 9 [10]
and inflict one quarter of their normal
damage (rounding down). This subject
is unaffected by any special or magical
attack forms of the monsters.
▶ If the save fails: The subject perceives the monsters as real creatures
of the chosen type. To this subject, the
shadow monsters attack as normal and
inflict normal damage. They may use
any special or magical attack forms they
possess, but attacks such as energy drain
or petrification do not really occur—at
worst, they might cause an opponent to
fall unconscious or be paralysed for 1d4
turns.

A wall of roiling vapour appears at a location of the caster’s choosing within range.
▶ Area: The fog bank fills a 10’ cube area
per level of the caster.
▶ Vision: The solid fog blocks normal
vision and infravision.
▶ Movement: Creatures moving through
the fog move at one tenth of their normal
movement rate.
▶ Strong winds: Only very strong winds
can clear the fog before the spell’s duration has expired.
▶ Magical fire: A large area of magical
fire can dissipate the fog in one round.

Veil of Abandonment
Duration: 1 turn per level
Range: 10’ per level
An area is cloaked with a combination of
invisibility and illusion, making it seem
vacant and neglected—covered in dust,
cobwebs, and dirt, as if long abandoned.
▶ Creatures: In the affected area when
the spell is cast are not cloaked.
▶ Inanimate objects: In the affected area
are cloaked with invisibility and are veiled
such that only direct contact will reveal
their presence. Even then, an observer
must make a saving throw versus spells
to realise that the whole area is under the
effects of an illusion: if the save fails, the
observer believes that the detected object
is merely invisible.
▶ Creatures passing through the
area: Believe that their passing makes
footprints in the dust, breaks through
cobwebs, etc.
▶ Detection: Creatures that can detect
invisible cannot see through this illusion.

points per Hit Die (instead of the normal
1d8 hit points per Hit Die).

caster’s control.

176

Saving throw: Every creature viewing the
shadow monsters may save versus spells:
▶ If the save succeeds: The subject views
the monsters as they truly are: vague,
shifting forms of shadow. To this subject,
the shadow monsters have AC 9 [10]
and inflict half of their normal damage
(rounding down). This subject is unaffected by any special or magical attack
forms of the monsters.
▶ If the save fails: The subject perceives the monsters as real creatures
of the chosen type. To this subject, the
shadow monsters attack as normal and
inflict normal damage. They may use
any special or magical attack forms they
possess, but attacks such as energy drain
or petrification do not really occur—at
worst, they might cause an opponent to
fall unconscious or be paralysed for 1d4
turns.

Illusion

Looking Glass

Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 240’

Duration: 1 round per level
Range: Touch

An illusion of the caster’s choosing—
including sounds, smells, and thermal
elements—manifests in a 20’ cube area.
Three types of illusions may be created:
1. An illusionary monster: That can be
directed to attack. The monster has
AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the
attacker may save versus spells. If the
save succeeds, the attacker realises the
illusory nature of the monster and can
no longer be harmed by it.
2. An illusionary attack: For example,
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
3. A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new.

A finely wrought, silver mirror is enchanted to act as a scrying device, allowing the caster to fleetingly view any place
or object that is brought to mind:
▶ The clarity of the vision: Depends on
the scryer’s familiarity with the subject.
▶ Casting spells: It is not possible to cast
spells through the mirror into the viewed
scene.
Material cost: The mirror enchanted
by this spell must be of at least 1,000gp
value.

Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Responsiveness: The illusion behaves
and responds as decided by the caster
when the spell is cast. No concentration
is required to maintain the illusion.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but never inflict
real damage. A character who appears to
die actually falls unconscious, a character
turned to stone will actually be paralysed,
and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

Major Creation
Duration: 12 or 6 turns per level
Range: Touch
Over the course of a turn, the caster
weaves a semi-real but tangible object
from a tiny piece of constituent matter.
For example, a sword could be formed
from a splinter of steel.
▶ Non-living: Only objects of non-living vegetable or mineral matter may be
created (e.g. fabric, rope, wood, metal,
stone, etc.).
▶ Size: The object may be no larger than
one cubic foot per level of the caster.
▶ Food: While it is possible to create
food, its semi-real nature means that it
provides no nourishment.
▶ Duration: If objects of vegetable matter are created, the duration is 12 turns
per level, otherwise it is 6 turns per level.
▶ When the duration ends: The conjured item disappears. The piece of matter
from which it was woven remains.

177

Maze of Mirrors

Projected Image

Duration: Varies by subject’s INT
Range: 5’ per level

Duration: 6 turns
Range: 240’

A single subject within range is transported into a shifting, extra-dimensional
mirror maze.
▶ Duration: The subject is trapped in
the maze for a duration depending on its
intelligence. See the table below.
▶ Escaping the maze: Once the subject
has found its way out of the maze, it reappears in the location it was transported
from.

An illusory duplicate of the caster appears within range.
▶ Duplicate: The image is an exact
duplicate of the caster that can only be
differentiated by touch.
▶ Subsequent spells cast: Appear to
originate from the image. (Targets must
still be visible to the caster, however.)
▶ Spells and missiles: The image
appears unaffected by spells or missile
weapons.
▶ Melee or touch: If the image is
touched or hit in melee, it disappears.

Seeming
Duration: 12 hours
Range: 10’
This spell alters the outward appearance
of one or more persons to that of another
type of humanoid.
▶ Number of subjects: Up to one subject per two levels of the caster may be
affected.
▶ The illusionary appearance: All subjects take on the appearance of the same
type of creature (e.g. human, elf, goblin,
etc.), but each remains a recognisable
individual—they do not look like clones.
▶ Size and weight: The illusionary
appearance may be at most 1’ taller or
shorter than the subject. Apparent weight
may be altered in any way.
▶ Clothing or equipment: May be
altered in any way.
▶ Cloning: The spell cannot be used to
precisely copy another’s appearance.
▶ Saving throw: Unwilling subjects may
save versus spells to avoid being affected.

Shadowcast
Duration: Up to 6 turns +1 per level
Range: 30’
The shadows cast by the light of a candle
are enchanted, causing them to re-enact
events which previously occurred in the
area where the spell is cast.
▶ Candle: The caster must light a candle
and place it in the centre of the area to
be affected, which must otherwise be
in darkness. The candle burns down completely over the spell’s duration.
▶ Time span: The caster may choose to
look back into the past up to six turns
plus one turn per level.
▶ Shadow play: Once the starting point
for the shadow re-enactment has been
selected, the spell lasts for that amount of
time, producing a shadowy replay of the
past up to the moment the spell was cast.
▶ Silhouettes: Only silhouettes of past
events in the area are produced; any
sound or speech which occurred is not
replicated.
Enhancement: The power of the illusion
may be enhanced by using a specially
manufactured candle:
▶ Special candle: The candle must be
formed from the earwax of a giant monster (which must be obtained by adventuring) and be inlaid with fine runes in
gold leaf (at a cost of 200gp).
▶ Sound: If such a candle is used, the
shadow play is also accompanied by
sound, faintly reproduced in the sputtering of the candle’s flame.

Shadowy Transformation
Duration: 1d4 rounds +1 per level
Range: The caster or a creature or object
touched
An object or creature touched becomes
shadowy and semi-ethereal.
If an object is touched:
▶ Insubstantial: The object becomes
utterly insubstantial. It cannot be touched
and provides no physical resistance. For
example, a door transformed by this spell
could be freely passed through.
▶ Size: The object may be no larger than
one cubic foot per level of the caster.
▶ Magical objects: Magic items and objects created by spells (e.g. a wall of stone)
cannot be targeted.
If a creature is touched:
▶ Insubstantial: The subject and
everything it carries becomes insubstantial.
▶ Movement: The subject is able to pass
through small holes and cracks.
▶ Invulnerability: Only ethereal creatures or magic may harm the subject.
▶ Pass undead: Undead will ignore the
subject, believing them to be a phantom
of some kind. Undead of 10 or more HD
may save versus spells (at a –4 penalty)
to notice the illusion.
▶ Saving throw: An unwilling subject
may save versus spells to avoid the transformation.

Time Flow

Visitation

Duration: 6 turns per level
Range: 10’

Duration: 5 minutes
Range: Unlimited

This powerful spell warps the flow of time
in the location where it is cast.
▶ Time acceleration: For those within
the area of effect, each turn that passes
has the subjective effect of a whole hour.
Within the affected area, spell durations
pass more quickly and characters must
eat and sleep at the accelerated rate.
▶ Rest: If enough perceptual time is
spent in the affected area, hit points may
be recovered due to rest and spells may
be re-memorized, subject to the normal
rules.
▶ Interaction: Any interaction between
characters within the enchanted area and
those outside of it occur at the normal
rate—characters inside the area of time
distortion do not gain or lose actions in
combat, for instance.
▶ Usage limit: Casting time flow more
than once in the space of a week causes a
permanent loss of one point of CON.

This spell sends an apparition to deliver a
message to a named subject.
▶ The apparition: Takes the form of
a ghostly figure of sinister or beguiling
aspect, as the caster wishes.
▶ The message delivered: May be up to
5 minutes long.
▶ Sympathetic item: The caster requires
an item of close personal connection to
the subject (e.g. a ring, commonly worn
garment, lock of hair, etc.).
▶ Saving throw: If the subject is unwilling, they may save versus spells to
prevent the visitation.

181

6th Level Spells
Acid Fog
Duration: 1d4 rounds +1 per level
Range: 30’
A wall of roiling, acidic vapour appears at
a location of the caster’s choosing within
range.
▶ Area: The fog bank fills a 10’ cube area
per level of the caster.
▶ Plant-life in the fog: Withers and
dies. Small shrubs and grasses perish in
two rounds, while large trees are more
resilient and may take up to 16 rounds to
finally blacken and die.
▶ Creatures in the fog: Suffer 1 damage
on the first round they are in the fog, 2
damage on the second round, 4 damage
on the third round, and 8 damage on
each subsequent round.
▶ Vision: The acid fog blocks normal
vision and infravision.
▶ Movement: Creatures moving through
the fog move at one tenth of their normal
movement rate.
▶ Strong winds: Only very strong winds
can clear the fog before the spell’s duration has expired.
▶ Magical fire: A large area of magical
fire can dissipate the fog in one round.

182

Dream Quest
Duration: Permanent until fulfilled
Range: 60’
The caster commands a single subject to
perform a specific quest or task, conveyed
through a recurring dream.
▶ The dream: While the spell remains
in effect, the subject experiences the
recurring dream every time they sleep. In
the recurring dream, the subject witnesses themselves completing the prescribed
quest.
▶ Examples of quests: Rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster, bringing
a magic item to the caster, or going on a
journey to an oracle.
▶ Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest
must not be obviously suicidal.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells, with success indicating that
the initial dream is experienced but the
spell has no further effect.
▶ Refusal: The subject must undertake
the quest or begin to fade from reality.
Every day in which the subject does not
pursue the quest, they lose 1 hit point.
This damage cannot be fatal (e.g. if the
subject has only 1 hit point, no further
loss due to this spell will occur). However, accrued damage cannot be healed by
any means except completing the quest.
▶ Completion: Once the task is completed, the spell ends. Any lost hit points
are recovered.

Manifest Dream
Duration: Varies by manifestation (see
examples below)
Range: The caster

Impersonation
Duration: 1 turn per level
Range: The caster or a person touched
The subject takes on the appearance of a
person of the caster’s choosing.
▶ Appearance: The subject becomes
physically indistinguishable from the
selected individual, becoming the same
height, age, race, sex, etc.
▶ Manner: Even the subject’s gestures,
voice, mode of speech, and mannerisms
are rendered identical to those of the
mimicked target.
▶ Mind: The subject does not gain any of
the memories, mental faculties, experiences, or abilities of the target.
▶ Observers: Who know the mimicked
target may save versus spells to detect
the illusion if the subject does or says
anything that the original would not.
Sympathetic item: The caster must have
a personal possession or bodily sample
(e.g. drop of blood, lock of hair) of the
target to be mimicked.

This spell harnesses the malleable, imaginative potency of the dream world,
manifesting the caster’s wish.
▶ Dreaming: After casting the spell, the
caster must lie down and drift off to sleep
while visualising the desired manifestation. The visualisation will then be
taken up by the caster’s subconscious and
experienced as a potent dream.
▶ Upon awakening: If the caster sleeps
for an uninterrupted 8 hours, the desired
manifestation comes to pass.
Potency: While manifest dream can bring
about a wide range of effects, its power is
not unlimited. The following are examples of the maximum potency of the spell:
▶ Healing: All of an individual’s wounds.
▶ Regeneration: Of a lost body part (e.g.
a hand or foot).
▶ Revelation: Of a route through the
wilderness, a secret entrance into a
fortress, or the location of a lost item. (As
long as the sought location or object is
not warded by magic.)
▶ Divination: Of the approximate
strength of enemy forces. (Creatures of
7 or more Hit Dice in the force may save
versus spells to avoid being detected in
this way.)
▶ Temporary restoration: Of a dead
creature or destroyed object for 1 turn
per level of the caster.
Usage limit: This spell may be used at
most once per week. A caster who oversteps this limit will become permanently
insane.

183

184

Mass Suggestion

Mislead

Duration: 4 turns +4 per level
Range: 90’

Duration: 1 round per level
Range: The caster

The caster utters a suggestion to influence
the behaviour of selected subjects within
range.
▶ Number of subjects: Up to one subject
per level of the caster may be targeted.
▶ Wording: The suggestion must take
the form of a short phrase (at most one
or two sentences) suggesting a course of
action to the subjects.
▶ Comprehension: A language that is
understood by the subjects must be used.
▶ Harmful suggestions: Suggestions
that are obviously harmful to a subject
cause the spell to automatically fail for
that subject.
▶ Saving throw: A save versus spells
is allowed to resist the suggestion. If
the save fails, the subject will follow the
caster’s suggestion for up to the duration
of the spell.
▶ Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion
that is worded in such a way to make it
sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.
Restrictions: Undead are unaffected.

This spell causes an illusory double of the
caster to appear while the real caster is
rendered invisible.
▶ Appearance: The illusion of the double includes visual, sonic, olfactory, and
tactile elements. It is an entirely convincing double of the caster.
▶ Action: The double may act completely independently, including moving,
speaking, attacking, and casting spells
(that the caster has memorized).
▶ Combat: The double has the same
combat capabilities as the caster and has a
separate pool of hit points, equal to those
of the caster when the spell is cast.
The caster: Is rendered invisible as
follows:
▶ Attacking: The caster may attack while
invisible.
▶ Being attacked: Opponents who are
aware of the caster’s presence (but who
cannot see invisible) may detect a faint
shimmering, allowing them to locate the
caster. The caster gains a +4 bonus to AC
and saving throws against such attacks.
▶ Equipment: Any gear the caster is
carrying is also rendered invisible (this
includes clothing and armour). Items
dropped or put down become visible.
▶ Light sources: If a light source is made
invisible (as part of the caster’s gear), the
light it casts is unaffected.

Permanent Illusion

Shades

Duration: Permanent
Range: 240’

Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 30’

An illusion of the caster’s choosing—
including sounds, smells, and thermal
elements—manifests in a 20’ cube area.
Two types of illusions may be created:
1. An illusionary monster: That can be
directed to attack. The monster has
AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the
attacker may save versus spells. If the
save succeeds, the attacker realises the
illusory nature of the monster and can
no longer be harmed by it.
2. A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new.

The caster conjures one or more semi-real monsters, woven from shadow-stuff.
▶ Hit Dice: The monsters’ total Hit Dice
may not exceed the caster’s level.
▶ Type: All monsters must be of the
same type.
▶ Hit points: The monsters have 1d6 hit
points per Hit Die (instead of the normal
1d8 hit points per Hit Die).
▶ Control: The monsters are under the
caster’s control.
Saving throw: Every creature viewing the
shadow monsters may save versus spells:
▶ If the save succeeds: The subject views
the monsters as they truly are: vague,
shifting forms of shadow. To this subject,
the shadow monsters have AC 9 [10]
and inflict three quarters of their normal
damage (rounding down). This subject
is unaffected by any special or magical
attack forms of the monsters.
▶ If the save fails: The subject perceives the monsters as real creatures
of the chosen type. To this subject, the
shadow monsters attack as normal and
inflict normal damage. They may use
any special or magical attack forms they
possess, but attacks such as energy drain
or petrification do not really occur—at
worst, they might cause an opponent to
fall unconscious or be paralysed for 1d4
turns.

Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Responsiveness: The illusion behaves
and responds as decided by the caster
when the spell is cast.
▶ Illusionary monsters: May appear to
be harmful but never inflict real damage.
A character who appears to die actually
falls unconscious, a character turned to
stone will actually be paralysed, and so
on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

185

Through the Looking Glass
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 10’
A finely wrought, full-length, silver
mirror is enchanted to act as a scrying
device, allowing the caster to view any
place or object that is brought to mind:
▶ The clarity of the vision: Depends on
the scryer’s familiarity with the subject.
▶ Casting spells: Through the mirror
into the viewed scene is not possible.
Stepping into the mirror: The caster may
step into the divined scene:
▶ Portal: A faint, spatial distortion exists
at the point at which the caster entered
the scene. The portal is invisible, but may
be perceived by the caster or by magic.
▶ Stepping back through: Anyone who
perceives the portal may step out of the
mirror and into the location whence the
caster originated.
▶ At the end of the spell’s duration: The
portal disappears. Any creature (including the caster) that stepped through the
portal/mirror and did not return must
save versus death or becomes lost in
another plane of reality.
Material cost: The mirror must be of at
least 5,000gp value.

Triggered Illusion
Duration: Permanent until triggered,
then 1 round per level
Range: 240’
An area within range is enchanted to produce an illusion of the caster’s choosing
—including sounds, smells, and thermal
elements—when a specified triggering
condition occurs. Once triggered, the
illusion manifests in a 20’ cube area, remaining for up to 1 round per level. The
enchantment then ends. Three types of
illusions may be created:
186

1. An illusionary monster: That can be
directed to attack. The monster has
AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the
attacker may save versus spells. If the
save succeeds, the attacker realises the
illusory nature of the monster and can
no longer be harmed by it.
2. An illusionary attack: For example,
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
3. A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new. The
scene disappears if touched.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Responsiveness: The illusion behaves
and responds as decided by the caster
when the spell is cast.
▶ Illusionary monsters: May appear to
be harmful but never inflict real damage.
A character who appears to die actually
falls unconscious, a character turned to
stone will actually be paralysed, and so
on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.
The trigger condition: May be as broad
or as specific as the caster wishes, and
may include conditions on objects in the
enchanted area being touched or on the
presence of creatures in the area. It may
only take visual appearances into account
(e.g. it cannot discern the alignment,
class, level, etc. of creatures who pass
through).

True Seeing
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: The caster or a creature touched
The subject sees all things within 60’ as
they truly are.
▶ Secret doors: Are revealed.
▶ Invisibility: Invisible objects and creatures are perceived.
▶ Illusions: Are seen through.
▶ Enchantments: Enchanted objects and
creatures are made apparent.

Vision
Duration: 1 turn
Range: The caster
The caster calls upon a supernatural power, asking to be sent a vision in answer to
a question which vexes them.
▶ The power to be called upon: May be
selected by the caster.

▶ Sacrifice: In order to supplicate the
power being contacted, the caster must
sacrifice something either valuable to
themselves or valuable to the supernatural power. More valuable sacrifices increase the chance of the caster’s question
being answered (see below).
The response of the power: Is determined by rolling 2d6:
▶ 2–6: The power is angered. No vision
is sent. Instead, the caster is placed under
a powerful enchantment forcing them to
perform some quest for the power.
▶ 7–9: A minor vision is sent. It may not
be directly related to the caster’s question.
▶ 10 or higher: A vision that answers
the caster’s question is sent.
Value of sacrifice: The 2d6 roll is
modified by the value of the sacrifice (as
judged by the referee):
▶ Very precious: +1
▶ Extremely precious: +2
▶ Priceless: +3

caster as its trusted friend and ally and
will come to the caster’s defence.
▶ Commands: If they share a language,
the caster may give the charmed creature
commands, which it will obey.
▶ Subject’s nature: Commands that
contradict the charmed creature’s habits
or alignment may be ignored.

creature never obeys suicidal or obviously
harmful orders.
Restrictions: Human-like monsters of
greater than 4+1 HD (see Hit point modifiers in the Advanced Fantasy Referee’s
Tome) and undead are not affected.

Light

Protection from Evil

Duration: 6 turns +1 per level
Range: 120’

Duration: 6 turns
Range: The caster

This spell has three usages:
1. Conjuring light: In a 15’ radius. The
magical light is sufficient for reading,
but is not as bright as daylight. The
spell may be cast upon an object, in
which case the light moves with the
object.
2. Blinding a creature: By casting the
spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a
saving throw versus spells, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature
cannot attack.
3. Cancelling darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below).

This spell wards the caster from attacks
by creatures of another alignment, as
follows:
▶ Bonuses: The caster gains a +1 bonus
to saving throws against attacks or special
abilities of affected creatures.
▶ Affected creatures’ attacks: Against
the caster are penalised by –1.
▶ Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures: The spell additionally
prevents such creatures from attacking
the caster in melee, though they may still
make ranged attacks. If the caster engages
such a creature in melee, this protection
is broken (the caster still gains the save
and attack bonuses mentioned above).

Reversed: Darkness

Creates a 15’ radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not
infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a
light spell.

Magic Missile
Duration: 1 turn
Range: 150’
This spell conjures a glowing dart of energy that the caster may choose to shoot at
a visible target within range.
▶ Hit: The missile hits unerringly (no
attack roll or saving throw is required).
▶ Damage: The missile inflicts 1d6+1
damage.
▶ Higher level casters: May conjure
more missiles: two additional missiles are
conjured per five experience levels the
caster has gained (i.e. three missiles at
6th–10th level, five missiles at 11th–15th
level, etc.). Multiple missiles may be
directed at a single target.

Read Languages
Duration: 2 turns
Range: The caster
For the duration of this spell, the caster
may read any language, coded message,
map, or other set of written instructions.
This spell does not grant any ability to
speak unknown languages.

191

Read Magic

Sleep

Duration: 1 turn
Range: The caster

Duration: 4d4 turns
Range: 240’

By means of read magic, the caster can
decipher magical inscriptions or runes, as
follows:
▶ Scrolls: The magical script of a scroll
of arcane spells can be understood. The
caster is then able to activate the scroll at
any time in the future.
▶ Spell books: A spell book written by
another arcane spell caster can be deciphered.
▶ Inscriptions: Runes or magical words
inscribed on an object or surface can be
understood.
▶ Reading again: Once the caster has
read a magical inscription using read
magic, they are thereafter able to read that
particular writing without recourse to the
use of this spell.

A sleep spell causes a magical slumber
to come upon creatures, excluding the
undead. The spell may target either:
1. A single creature with 4+1 Hit Dice
(see Hit point modifiers in the Advanced Fantasy Referee’s Tome).
2. A total of 2d8 Hit Dice of creatures of
4 HD or lower each.

Shield
Duration: 2 turns
Range: The caster
Shield creates an invisible field of force
that protects the caster:
▶ Against missile attacks: The caster’s
AC is 2 [17].
▶ Against other attacks: The caster’s AC
is 4 [15].

When targeting creatures of 4 HD or less,
the following rules apply:
▶ Weakest first: Targets with the least
HD are affected first.
▶ HD: Treat monsters with less than 1
HD as having 1 HD and monsters with
a fixed hit point bonus as having the flat
HD. (For example, a 3+2 HD monster
would be treated as having 3 HD.)
▶ Excess: Rolled Hit Dice that are not
sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
Killing: Creatures enchanted by this spell
are helpless and can be killed instantly
with a bladed weapon.
Awakening: Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature.

192

2nd Level Spells
Continual Light
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120’
This spell has three usages:
1. Conjuring light: In a 30’ radius. The
magical light is sufficient for reading,
but is not as bright as daylight. The
spell may be cast upon an object, in
which case the light moves with the
object.
2. Blinding a creature: By casting the
spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a
saving throw versus spells, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling darkness: Continual light
may cancel a continual darkness spell
(see below).

Reversed: Continual Darkness

Creates a 30’ radius area of magical blackness, preventing both normal sight and
infravision. Light sources brought within
the area of darkness do not illuminate it.
Like continual light, it may alternatively
be used to blind creatures or to dispel a
continual light spell.

Duration: 2 turns
Range: 60’
Objects enchanted for evil purposes or
living beings with evil intentions are
caused to magically glow.
▶ Intent only: This spell does not grant

decide what is “evil”. Some things that are
potentially harmful, like traps, are not
“evil.”

Invisible creatures or items in range are
revealed to the caster.

ESP
Duration: 12 turns

the caster must focus their concentration
in one direction for one turn.
▶ After this turn: The thoughts of all
creatures within range in that direction
can be perceived.
▶ Multiple creatures: If multiple creatures are within the range in the direction
being focused on, their thoughts mingle
into a confusing jumble. The caster must
spend an additional turn to sort out one
creature’s thoughts.
▶ Meaning: The caster understands the
meaning of all thoughts even if they do
not share the creature’s language.
▶ Obstructions: The ability to perceive
thoughts is obstructed by a thin layer of
lead or by rock of 2’ thick or greater.

The caster or another creature or object
within range becomes invisible:
▶ If cast on a creature: Any gear the

attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is
broken, ending the spell.
▶ If cast on an object: The invisibility is
permanent.
▶ Light sources: If a light source is made
invisible (either as part of a creature’s gear
or as an individual object), the light it
casts is unaffected.

Knock

Range: 60’
The knock spell opens stuck, barred, or
locked doors, gates, chests, and so forth.
▶ Magically held doors: Are affected
(e.g. hold portal, wizard lock).

not distance) of an object. One of two
types of objects may be located:
1. General class: An object of a general
class (e.g. a stairway, an altar, etc.).
In this case, the nearest object of that
type is located.
2. Specific object: A specific object
known to the caster.
Restrictions: This spell cannot be used to
locate creatures.

Web
Duration: 48 turns
Range: 10’

Phantasmal Force
Duration: Concentration
Range: 240’
A visual illusion of the caster’s choosing
manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types
of illusions may be created:
1. An illusionary monster: That can be
directed to attack. The monster has an
Armour Class of 9 [10] and will vanish
if hit in combat.
2. An illusionary attack: For example,
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
3. A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new. The
scene disappears if touched.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Concentration: Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves or
loses concentration, the spell ends.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever inflicted. A character who
appears to die actually falls unconscious,
a character turned to stone will actually
be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last
for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

Web conjures a many-layered mass of
strong, sticky threads, blocking a 10’ cube
area.
▶ Entanglement: Creatures caught
within a web become entangled among
the gluey fibres. Entangled creatures can’t
move, but can break free depending on
their strength (see below).
▶ Flammable: The strands of the web
are flammable and can be destroyed by
fire in two rounds. All creatures caught
within flaming webs suffer 1d6 points of
damage from the flames.
Breaking free: Depends on STR:
▶ Normal human range: The creature

wizard lock.
▶ A knock spell: Allows passage.
▶ Higher level casters: Any magic-using
character who is at least 3 levels higher
than the caster of the wizard lock may
pass through unimpeded.
Temporary: Bypassing does not destroy a
wizard lock.
195

3rd Level Spells

of one creature within range in that direction are relayed to the caster.
▶ Switching: Once a connection is established, the caster may choose to maintain
it or to change to another subject.

a thin layer of lead or by rock of 2’ thick
or greater.

Dispel Magic
Duration: Instant

Contact Higher Plane
Duration: One conversation
Range: The caster
A channel of communication is opened
to a higher plane of existence, allowing
the caster to ask powerful, otherworldly
beings for advice and knowledge on any
subject.
▶ Plane: The caster must choose which
plane of existence to contact: communion
with beings of the 3rd to 12th planes is
possible via this spell. Higher numbered
planes are home to more powerful and
knowledgeable beings.
▶ Questions: The caster may then ask a
number of simple yes/no questions equal
to the number of the plane contacted. The
referee plays the role of the contacted being, responding to the caster’s questions.
▶ Answers: For each question asked,
there is a chance of the contacted being
not knowing the answer or of answering
untruthfully: see the table to the right. It
is impossible to detect whether the entity
is lying.
Restrictions: Casting contact higher plane
is a great and perilous deed.
▶ Usage limit: It may be cast at most
once per week. (The referee may limit
the spell’s usage to even less frequently, if
desired.)
▶ Insanity: Communion with otherworldly beings of great power can shatter
the caster’s sanity. The basic chance is
shown in the table above. For every
level of the caster above 11, this chance
is reduced by 5%. If the caster is driven
insane as a result of the communion, the
recovery time is a number of weeks equal
to the number of the plane contacted.

When the caster’s life-force is in the
magic jar:
▶ Possession: The caster may attempt
to possess the body of another creature
within 120’. The victim may save versus

to the caster, eating or drinking without
restraint, keeping a certain fact secret.
▶ Impossible or deadly tasks: The
prescribed geas must not be impossible or
directly deadly—if such a geas is cast, it
affects the caster, instead.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells, to avoid coming under the
spell’s effect.
▶ If the save fails: The subject must
follow the stipulated course of action or
suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by the referee (e.g. penalties to attack, ability score
reductions, inability to memorize spells,
physical torment and feebleness, etc.).

Reversed: Remove Geas

Can dispel an active geas spell and any
incurred penalties. If the caster of the
geas to be nullified is higher level than the
character casting remove geas, there is a
chance of the spell having no effect. The
probability of spell failure is 5% per level
the caster is below the caster of geas.

Invisible Stalker

Highly intelligent, magical creatures summoned from another plane of existence to
perform tasks for powerful magic-users.

▶ If killed: Returns to plane of origin.

Lower Water
Duration: 10 turns
Range: 240’
This spell reduces the depth of a body of
water by half for the duration. An area of
up to 10,000 square feet may be affected.

209

Move Earth

Reincarnation

Duration: 6 turns
Range: 240’

Duration: Permanent
Range: Appears in the caster’s presence

Earth (but not stone) within range is
rearranged as the caster wishes.
▶ Movement rate: The caster can move
earth in the area at up to 60’ per turn.
▶ Excavations: The range of the spell
also extends downwards, allowing excavations to be made.

A dead character is returned to life in a
new physical form that manifests in the
presence of the caster. The character’s
new body is not necessarily the same as
the original; it is determined by rolling on
the Reincarnated Class table opposite.
The roll indicates either a character class
or a monster:
▶ Character class: The character is of
experience level 1d6 (or at most the same
level as the character achieved before
death). The reincarnated character can
continue to gain experience and advance
as normal, in the new class.
▶ Monster: The type should be determined by the referee. The monster should
be at least partially intelligent, have no
greater Hit Dice than the level of the
character being reincarnated (at most 6
HD), and be of the same alignment. The
tables opposite may be used, or the referee may create their own tables. Monsters
cannot gain experience or advance in
level.

Part Water
Duration: 6 turns
Range: 120’
The caster creates a path 10’ wide and a
maximum of 120’ long through water,
such as a pond, lake, or other body. The
caster can dismiss the spell’s effect before
the duration ends.

Projected Image
Duration: 6 turns
Range: 240’
An illusory duplicate of the caster appears within range.
▶ Duplicate: The image is an exact
duplicate of the caster that can only be
differentiated by touch.
▶ Subsequent spells cast: Appear to
originate from the image. (Targets must
still be visible to the caster, however.)
▶ Spells and missiles: The image
appears unaffected by spells or missile
weapons.
▶ Melee or touch: If the image is
touched or hit in melee, it disappears.

210

Stone to Flesh
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120’
This spell transforms stone into living
flesh. It is especially useful for restoring
life to a petrified creature and its equipment to its normal state.

Reversed: Flesh to Stone

Turns one creature into a statue, including all gear and any items currently held.
A saving throw versus paralysis is permitted to resist the transformation.

Alternative Reincarnation Tables
The classes listed in the tables are drawn
from this book and the monsters from
the Advanced Fantasy Referee’s Tome.
If other classes or monsters are in use,
the referee may wish to create alternative reincarnation tables.

211

Adventuring
Party Organisation
Size: The ideal size of a group is between
6 and 8 characters—large enough to
confront the challenges of the adventure,
while not so large as to be disorganised.
If not enough PCs are present, the players
may wish to hire retainers (see p110).
Classes: It is wise for a party to consist of a mix of characters of different
adventuring classes. Combat-focused
characters are essential for protecting the
group from danger, while other classes
each have magic or other special abilities
which are useful for handling different
situations that may arise in an adventure.
Level: As new PCs join play, the experience levels of the characters in the party
may diverge. It is recommended that
characters more than four levels apart
should adventure separately, as challenges and rewards suitable to characters of
greatly different experience levels do not
match.

Marching Order
Before starting an adventure, the players
should determine the normal arrangement of their PCs when exploring. This is
known as the party’s marching order. For
example, players may decide to move in
a two-column formation, with well-armoured characters in front, weaker characters in the middle, and a rear guard.
The group may define different standard
marching orders for common situations
(e.g. standard exploration, combat, opening doors, searching, etc.).
212

The Caller
If the players wish to, they may nominate
one of their number as the spokesperson
of the group, known as the caller. This
player is responsible for informing the
referee about the actions and movements
of the party as a whole. Delegating this
role to one player—rather than having
each player informing the referee about
their PC’s individual actions—can speed
up play.
The caller’s character usually takes on the
role of party leader and should thus have
a high Charisma score and be located
near to the front of the party.

The Mapper
One player should create a map of the areas being explored, based on the referee’s
descriptions. Details such as monsters or
traps encountered, clues to puzzles, or
possibly interesting unexplored areas may
be noted on the map as it is drawn.

Dividing Treasure
The spoils of an adventure may be
divided between surviving characters in
whatever way the players agree on.
Non-magical treasure: Is typically divided evenly between player characters.
Magic items: The players must decide
which character keeps each item. One
method for doing this is for each player
to roll a die and compare the results. The
highest rolling player gets to pick a magic
item first, the second highest rolling player gets the next pick, and so on.

213

Time, Weight, and
Movement
Tracking Time
When an adventure is under way, the
referee should keep track of the time that
elapses in the imagined world, known as
game time. This is distinct from real time:
what may take the players and referee
mere seconds to describe may take PCs
hours or even days to complete.
For example, when characters are exploring a dungeon, the referee tracks the
number of turns that have elapsed; when
characters are exploring the wilderness,
the number of days elapsed is tracked.
The referee must adjudicate what may be
accomplished in a given period of time.

Resources

As game time passes, the referee should
pay attention to resources that the party
consumes. For example: food, water, fuel
for light sources, durations of spells or
magical effects, etc.

Tracking Movement
As player characters explore the imagined world, the referee should keep
track of their location on a prepared map.
The map is usually kept secret from the
players, who must rely on the referee’s
descriptions of the areas they explore.
To determine how long it takes for characters to move from one area to the next,
the referee should refer to the characters’
movement rates (see p13).

Group Movement Rate

An adventuring party will usually want
to stay together. The movement rate of
the party as a whole is determined by the
speed of the slowest member.
214

Measurements
Time: Rounds and Turns

Aside from everyday time increments
(minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game.
Turns: 10 minutes of game time. There
are 6 turns in an hour. Time is measured
in turns when exploring dungeons (see
Dungeon Adventuring, p222).
Rounds: 10 seconds of game time. There
are 60 rounds in a turn. Time is measured
in rounds during encounters, especially
in combat (see Encounters, p228 and
Combat, p234).

Distance: Inches, Feet, Yards, Miles

Staying true to its origins, this game uses
imperial or customary US units. Distances are measured in inches (notated with
a ”), feet (notated with a ’), yards, and
miles.

Distance Conversions
▶ 1 foot = 12 inches
▶ 1 yard = 3 feet
▶ 1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet

Weight: Coins

Weight measures typically come into
play only when discussing how much
characters can carry (see Encumbrance,
opposite). As coins are the most common
form of treasure found by adventurers, all
weights are measured in coins. (Ten coins
are equivalent to one pound.)

Encumbrance (Optional Rule)
Some groups may wish to use a system to
track the amount of gear and treasure a
character can carry and how this affects
their movement rate.

Tracking Encumbrance

Encumbrance is a measure of both the
weight and bulk a character is carrying.
Treasure: The encumbrance of treasure
carried by a character should be tracked.
The encumbrance of common items of
treasure is shown in the table below. The
referee should decide the weight of other
forms of treasure.
Equipment: Two options for tracking the
encumbrance of characters’ equipment
are presented to the right. The same system should be applied to all characters.
Maximum load: The maximum load
any character can carry is 1,600 coins of
weight. Characters carrying more than
this cannot move.

Option 1: Basic Encumbrance

Treasure: The weight of treasure carried
is tracked to make sure that the character’s maximum load is not exceeded.
Equipment: The weight of armour, weapons, and adventuring gear is not tracked
and does not count towards a character’s
maximum load.
Movement rate: Is determined by the
type of armour the character is wearing
and whether they are carrying a significant amount of treasure (as judged by the
referee). The actual weight of the treasure
carried does not affect movement rate.

Option 2: Detailed Encumbrance

Treasure: The weight of coins and other
treasure carried is tracked.
Equipment: The weight of the character’s armour and weapons is also tracked
(the weight of these items is listed in the
equipment list). Miscellaneous adventuring gear (backpack, spikes, sacks, etc.)
may be counted as 80 coins of weight.
Movement rate: The character’s movement rate is based on the total weight of
all significant items carried, including
treasure, weapons, and armour.

Ability Checks
The referee may use a character’s ability scores to determine the character’s
chance of succeeding at various challenging tasks.

Bonuses or penalties to the roll may be
applied, depending on the difficulty of
the task. A modifier of –4 would be a relatively easy ability check, and a +4 would
be very difficult.

Rolling an Ability Check

1s and 20s

The player rolls 1d20 and, if the result is
less than or equal to the ability, the check
succeeds. If the roll is greater than the
ability, the check fails.

216

Modifiers

A natural 1 should be treated as a success
and a natural 20 treated as a failure.

Saving Throws
All characters and monsters can make
saving throws to avoid the full effects of
certain magical or special attacks.

Categories
There are five saving throw categories,
used in the following situations:
▶ Death or Poison (D): When targeted
by a death ray or exposed to poison.
▶ Wands (W): When targeted by an
effect from a magical wand.
▶ Paralysis or Petrification (P): When
targeted by an effect that paralyses or
turns to stone.
▶ Breath Attacks (B): When targeted by
the breath of a dragon (or other monster
with a breath attack).
▶ Spells, Rods, or Staves (S): When targeted by a baneful spell or an effect from
a magical rod or staff.

When to Roll a Saving Throw
The appropriate saving throw to make
and the effects of a success or failure are
indicated in the description of the spell,
monster attack, or adventure scenario.

Saving Throw Tables
Each character class has its own table
denoting the saving throw values of characters of each experience level.

Rolling a Saving Throw
When affected by a spell or attack form
which requires a saving throw, the player
or referee must roll 1d20 and compare
the result to the appropriate saving throw
value:
▶ Greater or equal: A result that is
greater than or equal to the saving throw
value is a success.
▶ Lower: A result of less than the saving
throw value is a failure.

Successful Saves
Damaging effects: A successful save
against an effect that causes damage
means that the damage is halved.
Other effects: A successful saving throw
against an effect that does not cause damage means the effect has been entirely
avoided or negated.

Saving Throws Versus Poison
Failure: A failed save against poison is
usually fatal.
Damage: If a poisonous attack also inflicts damage, the damage is not affected
by the success or failure of the save.
217

Damage, Healing,
and Death
Damage
All characters and monsters have a hit
point total, which represents their ability
to avoid death. Many attack forms, including attacks with weapons in combat,
subtract hit points from this pool.

Healing
Natural Healing

For each full day of complete rest, a character or monster recovers 1d3 hit points.
If the rest is interrupted, the character or
monster will not heal that day.

Magical Healing

Healing may also occur through magic,
such as potions or spells. This kind of
healing is instantaneous. Magical healing
and natural healing can be combined.

218

Death
A character or monster reduced to 0 hit
points or less is killed.

Destruction of Items

If a character is killed by a destructive
spell or special attack (e.g. a lightning bolt
spell or a dragon’s breath), their equipment is assumed to be destroyed.

Destruction of Magic Items

Magic items in the possession of a character who is killed by a destructive spell
or special attack may be allowed a chance
to survive, as follows:
▶ Save: For each item, a saving throw
may be made using the character’s saving
throw values.
▶ Bonuses: Items that grant a bonus
in combat (e.g. magical weapons and
armour) may also apply this bonus to the
saving throw.

Limits on Returning from Death
(Optional Rule)
Maximum Number of Times

A character’s initial Constitution score
(i.e. the score at character creation)
defines the number of times that they
can be returned from the dead by magic.
Once this limit is reached, death is final,
barring extraordinary magic such as a
wish or the direct intervention of a deity.

Chance of Success

Returning from death represents a huge
shock to a character, and it is not guaranteed that they will be successfully brought
back to life. The chance of resurrection
magic succeeding depends on a character’s Constitution score as shown in the
table to the right.

Hazards and
Challenges
Climbing

Characters or monsters that carry a light
in a dark environment are usually unable
to surprise opponents (see Encounters,
p228), because the light gives their
presence away.

Falling

When characters are climbing in a difficult or tense situation, the referee may
require an ability check against Dexterity.

Falling from a height onto a hard surface
inflicts 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen.

Sheer Surfaces

Losing Direction

Darkness

Characters can confidently follow trails,
roads, and other well-known landmarks
without fear of becoming lost. Likewise,
travelling with a reliable guide prevents
becoming lost. However, when travelling
through untracked, open regions, it is
easy to lose direction.
The chance of the party becoming lost
depends on the type of terrain being
explored (see Wilderness Adventuring,
p224 and Waterborne Adventuring,
p226).

Very steep or sheer surfaces are normally
impossible to climb without specialised
equipment. Some characters may have
class abilities which allow them to attempt to climb such surfaces unaided.

Characters will usually want to bring
a source of light with them on underground expeditions. Typical light sources
enable normal vision within a 30’ radius.

Infravision

All non-human monsters and many
demihuman races have a special kind of
vision that allows them to see in the dark.
This is called infravision.
Heat tones: Characters who have infravision can see the heat energy that radiates
off of living things. Generally, living
things will be visible as bright tones,
while cool items are grey and very cold
objects are black.
Reading: It is not possible to read in the
dark with infravision, because fine detail
cannot be perceived.
Range: Infravision works within a limited
range (60’ for monsters, unless specified
otherwise in a monster’s description).
Disruption: Infravision only functions in
darkness. Visible light (normal or magical) and large heat sources will disrupt it.
220

Light and Surprise

Effects of Being Lost

If the party becomes lost, the referee
will decide which direction they are
actually travelling in. One option is to
pick a direction only slightly off course.
For example, if the group intended to go
south, they are actually headed southwest
or west.
It may take some time for a lost party
to realise that it is moving in the wrong
direction.

Starvation
If characters go for a full day or more
without food or water, the referee may
begin to apply penalties to attack rolls
and movement rate, require more frequent rests, or even begin to deduct hit
points (in extreme cases).

Swimming
Movement rate: Characters move at
half their normal movement rate when
swimming.
Who can swim: It is assumed that every
character knows how to swim, unless
there is some obvious reason why a character could not have learned.

Drowning

The circumstances in which drowning is
a risk—as well as the chance of drowning—are judged by the referee.
Example circumstances: Swimming in
treacherous water conditions, swimming
while wearing armour or carrying heavy
or awkward items, fighting in water.
Example chances of drowning: A character swimming in rough waters while
wearing heavy armour and carrying a
heavy load may have a 99% probability of
drowning. A character in the same waters
but wearing light armour and carrying a
light load may only have a 10% probability of drowning.

Wandering Monsters
Besides the monsters specifically placed
in certain regions of a dungeon or wilderness, PCs may randomly encounter monsters on the move between areas. These
are known as wandering monsters.
See Dungeon Adventuring, p222,
Wilderness Adventuring, p224, and
Waterborne Adventuring, p226 for
specific details.
Frequency: The referee should roll
periodically to determine whether a
wandering monster is encountered. The
frequency of checks depends on the type
of area being explored.

Chance: When a wandering monster
check is made, the chance of a random
encounter is usually 1-in-6. This chance
may vary, depending on the type of area
being explored (e.g. dungeon region or
level, type of wilderness terrain).
Monster type: Each area should have its
own table of wandering monsters, which
the referee rolls on when an encounter
takes place.
Noise or light: If the party is making a lot
of noise or carrying bright light sources
in a dark environment, the referee may
increase the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.
Hiding: If the party rests quietly in an
out-of-the-way location, the referee may
decrease the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.
221

Dungeon
Adventuring
Sequence of Play Per Turn
1. Wandering monsters: The referee
makes checks as applicable.
2. Actions: The party decides what actions to take (e.g. moving, searching,
listening, entering rooms).
3. Description: The referee describes
what happens. If monsters are
encountered, follow the procedure
described in Encounters, p228.
4. End of turn: The referee updates
time records, with special attention
to light sources, spell durations, and
the party’s need to rest.

Doors
Dungeons often have many doors, some
secret and others obvious. Many are
locked and many are stuck.

Searching for Secret Doors

Some doors are hidden or concealed.
Adventurers may choose to search a 10’ ×
10’ area for secret doors. See Searching.
Chance of finding: If a character is
searching in the right location, there is
a 1-in-6 chance of finding a secret door.
(Some types of adventurers may have an
increased chance.)

Stuck Doors

Forcing: The chance of forcing open a
stuck door depends on the character’s
Strength (see Ability Scores, p20).
Surprise: A failed attempt to force open a
door eliminates any possibility of surprise
(see Encounters, p228) that the party
may have against any monsters on the
other side of the door.
222

Locked Doors

Locks may be picked by a character proficient with lock picks or opened by magic.

Doors Swinging Shut

Doors opened by adventurers (by whatever means) are likely to swing shut after
they pass. To prevent this, doors may
be held open using iron spikes or other
wedges.

Monsters and Doors

Monsters that live in the dungeon can
usually open doors (even stuck doors),
unless they are blocked, magically closed,
or wedged shut with spikes.

Listening at Doors

Chance of success: PCs have a 1-in-6
chance of detecting subtle sounds beyond
a door. (Some types of adventurers may
have an increased chance of success.)
Referee rolls: The referee should always
roll for the character listening so that the
player never knows if the roll failed or if
there simply is no sound behind the door.
One chance: This attempt may only be
made one time at any door by a character.
Silent monsters: Some monsters, such as
undead, do not make any noise.

Movement
Exploring the unknown: When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon,
characters can move their base movement
rate in feet per turn. This (very slow!) rate
of movement takes account for the fact
that PCs are exploring, watching their
footing, mapping, and trying to be quiet
and avoid obstacles.
In familiar areas: When PCs are moving
through dungeon areas with which they
are familiar, the referee may allow them
to move at a faster rate. For example, the
referee might allow PCs to move at three
times their base movement rate per turn,
when moving through familiar areas.

Searching

Resting
Frequency of rest: Characters must rest
for one turn every hour in the dungeon.
Penalty for not resting: If characters
press on without resting, they suffer a
penalty of –1 to attack and damage rolls
until they have rested for one turn.

Traps
There are two kinds of traps:
▶ Treasure traps: Small traps placed
on an item, to prevent it being tampered
with or stolen (e.g. a poison needle on a
chest or lock).
▶ Room traps: Large traps that are
designed to affect anyone who enters a
certain area (e.g. a pit that opens in the
floor when walked over).

Triggering Traps

Each trap is triggered by a specific action
(e.g. opening a door or walking over a
particular area).
Chance of triggering: Every time a character makes an action that could trigger
a trap, there is a 2-in-6 chance of the trap
being sprung.
Trap damage: Damage inflicted by a triggered trap is usually automatic, without
an attack roll.
Monsters: Monsters may be able to bypass
traps without risk, if the referee wishes.

The following stipulations apply to
searching for secret doors, room traps,
and treasure traps.
Time: Searching takes one turn.
Referee rolls: The referee should always
roll for the character searching, so that
the player does not know if the roll
failed or if there are simply no hidden
features present.
One chance: Each character can only
make one attempt to search a specific
area or item.

Searching for Room Traps

Adventurers may choose to search a 10’ ×
10’ area for room traps. See Searching.
Chance of finding: If a character is
searching in the right location, there is
a 1-in-6 chance of finding a room trap.
(Some types of adventurers may have an
increased chance.)

Searching for Treasure Traps

Characters with the ability to find treasure traps (as noted in their class description) may choose to search items (e.g.
chests, locks) for traps. See Searching.
Chance of finding: The chance of finding
treasure traps, if a character is searching
in the right location, is noted in the character’s class description.

Wandering Monsters
Frequency: A check is typically rolled
once every two turns in the dungeon.
Chance: The typical chance of encountering a wandering monster is 1-in-6.
Distance: Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 × 10 feet away, moving in
the direction of the party.

223

Wilderness
Adventuring
Sequence of Play Per Day
1. Decide course: The players decide
on their course of travel for the day.
2. Losing direction: The referee determines whether the party gets lost.
3. Wandering monsters: The referee
makes checks as applicable.
4. Description: The referee describes
the terrain passed through and any
sites of interest that the party comes
across, asking players for their
actions, as required. If monsters are
encountered, follow the procedure
described in Encounters, p228.
5. End of day: The referee updates time
records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party’s
need to rest.

Distance and Measurement
The open spaces of the wilderness mean
that characters and monsters can move
more freely than in a dungeon.
Ranges and movement rates: Are
measured in yards, instead of feet. This
means that ranges and movement rates
are tripled.
Areas: Of spell effects, breath weapons,
etc. are still measured in feet.

224

Flying
Miles per day: The distance a creature
can fly in a day is double the distance it
can travel overland (see Overland Travel).
For example, a creature with a movement
rate of 120’ could travel 24 miles in a day
overland, but could fly 48 miles in a day.
Terrain: Does not affect air travel.

Flying Mounts

In general, a winged beast may carry riders or other burdens based on its HD:
▶ 3 HD creatures: May carry a being
about half the size of an adult human.
▶ 6 HD creatures: May carry an adult
human.
▶ 12 HD creatures: May carry a large
animal like a horse.
▶ 24 HD creatures: May carry a very
large animal like an elephant.

Foraging
Foraging for herbs, fruits, nuts, etc. can
be performed alongside normal movement (see Overland Travel). The party
has a 1-in-6 chance per day of finding
enough food for 1d6 human-sized beings.

Hunting
Hunting must be engaged in as the sole
activity for a day—no travelling or resting
is possible. When hunting, there is a 1-in6 chance of encountering animals which
may be suitable for eating (if they can be
caught!). This is in addition to the normal
chance of random encounters (see Wandering Monsters).

Losing Direction

Resting

At the start of each day of travel, the referee should roll to determine if the group
loses direction. The probability depends
on the terrain being traversed:
▶ Clear, grasslands: 1-in-6.
▶ Barren lands, hills, mountains,
woods: 2-in-6.
▶ Desert, jungle, swamp: 3-in-6.

Frequency of rest: Characters must rest
for one day per six days of travel.
Penalty for not resting: If characters
press on without resting, they suffer a
penalty of –1 to hit and damage rolls until
they have rested for one full day.

Effects: See Losing Direction, p220.

Overland Travel
Miles per day: The number of miles a
character can travel in a day is determined by dividing their base movement
rate by five. For example, a character
whose base movement rate is 120’ could
travel up to 24 miles in a day.

Terrain Modifiers

Some types of terrain modify the speed at
which characters can travel:
▶ Broken lands, desert, forest, hills:
33% slower.
▶ Jungle, mountains, swamp:
50% slower.
▶ Maintained roads: 50% faster.

Forced March

If characters need to travel further in a
day, they may engage in a forced march.
Speed increase: The distance travelled is
increased by 50%. For example, a character that can normally travel 24 miles in a
day could travel 36 miles.
Rest: After a forced march, characters
must rest for a full day.

Surprise
Surrounded: If a party is surprised by
three or more monsters, the monsters
may have moved to encircle the party.

Visibility
Characters can usually see for three
miles around them, in open terrain. This
range may sometimes be reduced (e.g.
in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or
increased (e.g. looking out from the top
of a mountain).

Wandering Monsters
Frequency: A check is typically rolled
once per day, but the referee may choose
to make more checks: up to three or four
per day.
Chance: The chance of encountering a
wandering monster depends on the terrain being explored (see below).
Distance: Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either
side is surprised (see Encounters, p228),
this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.

Chance by Terrain

▶ City, clear, grasslands, settled lands:
1-in-6.
▶ Aerial, barren, desert, forest, hills:
2-in-6.
▶ Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.

225

Waterborne
Adventuring
Sequence of Play Per Day
1. Decide course: The players decide
on their course of travel for the day.
2. Losing direction: The referee determines whether the party gets lost.
3. Weather: The referee determines the
Wind Conditions.
4. Wandering monsters: The referee
makes checks as applicable.
5. Description: The referee describes
the regions passed through and
any sites of interest that the party
comes across, asking players for their
actions, as required. If monsters are
encountered, follow the procedure
described in Encounters, p228.
6. End of day: The referee updates time
records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the crew’s
need to rest.

Distance and Measurement
Ranges and movement rates: Are
measured in yards, instead of feet. This
means that ranges and movement rates
are tripled.
Areas: Of spell effects, breath weapons,
etc. are still measured in feet.

Losing Direction
With a navigator aboard: The chance of
getting lost is 2-in-6.
Without a navigator aboard: The chance
of getting lost is 100% on the open seas
and 2-in-6 within sight of land.
Effects: See Losing Direction, p220.

226

Surprise
Aquatic monsters are usually not surprised by ships. Special circumstances
(e.g. thick fog) may alter this.

Travel on the Water
Miles per day: The number of miles a
creature or vessel can travel in a day is determined by dividing its base movement
rate by five. For example, a vessel with a
base movement rate of 360’ could travel
up to 72 miles in a day.

Modifiers

The distance travelled in a day may be
affected by the prevailing water and
weather conditions:
▶ River travel: Water currents may
increase (when moving downstream) or
decrease (when moving upstream) the
distance travelled by 1d6+6 miles per day.
▶ Sailing: The movement rate of sailing
vessels is affected by the prevailing wind
conditions. See Wind Conditions.

Visibility
Land: On a clear day, land can be spotted
at a distance of 24 miles. This may be
reduced based on light and weather
conditions.
Ships: May be sighted and identified at
300 yards on a clear day or as little as 40
yards in dense fog.

Wandering Monsters
Frequency: A check is typically rolled
once per day, but the referee may choose
to make more checks: up to 3 or 4 a day.
Chance: The chance of encountering a
wandering monster is 2-in-6 on oceans or
rivers, 3-in-6 in swamps.
Distance: Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either
side is surprised (see Encounters, p228),
this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.
Location: Aquatic encounters may occur
either on the open water or on land, if the
party docks at some point during the day.

Wind Conditions
Wind conditions at sea affect the rate at
which a sailing vessel can travel. Extreme
winds can also make travel hazardous.
The referee should check the wind conditions at the start of each day, rolling 2d6:
▶ 2: No wind; sailing is not possible.
▶ 3–11: Normal sailing is possible.
▶ 12: Gale or storm; sailing vessels’
speed tripled (see Gales and Storms).

Variable Wind Conditions (Optional Rule)

Groups who prefer a slightly more
detailed system of sea travel may use the
table above, which adds extra detail to the
daily 2d6 wind conditions roll.

Near Gales

Seaworthy vessels: Have a 10% chance of
taking on water.
Unseaworthy vessels: Have a 20% chance
of taking on water.
Effect of taking on water: The ship’s
movement rate is reduced by one third
until repaired at a dock.

Gales and Storms

Seaworthy vessels: Sailing vessels can
attempt to move with the wind to avoid
damage. This is handled as follows:
▶ The vessel travels at three times its
normal speed in a randomly determined
direction. (The referee may roll 1d6,
with 1 indicating the intended direction
of travel, 2 indicating 60° to the right, 3
indicating 120° to the right, and so on.)
▶ If the ship encounters land during this
travel, there is a 75% chance of it wrecking against the shore.
Unseaworthy vessels:
▶ There is an 80% chance of the vessel
being overrun with water and sinking.
▶ If the vessel is in sight of land when
the gale hits, it may attempt to beach. If
the shore is relatively clear of physical
dangers (rocks, cliffs, etc.), this is automatically successful; otherwise there is a
2-in-6 chance of finding a safe harbour to
weather the storm.
227

Encounters
An encounter begins when the characters
stumble onto a monster, either because
the referee has planned an encounter in
the area the PCs are exploring or because
a random die roll indicates an encounter
(see Wandering Monsters, p221).

Encounter Sequence
1. Surprise: The referee rolls for surprise, if applicable.
2. Encounter distance: The referee determines how far away the monsters
are from the PCs.
3. Initiative: Any sides that are not
surprised roll initiative to determine
who acts first.
4. Actions: Any sides that are not surprised decide how they will respond
to the encounter. The encounter is
played out accordingly.
5. Conclusion: One turn has passed.

Surprise Checks

Each side that is not already aware of the
other’s presence rolls 1d6.
Monsters: The referee rolls for monsters.
PCs: One player rolls for the adventuring
party as a whole.
Results: A result of 1 or 2 means the side
is surprised.

Effects of Surprise

Both sides surprised: There is simply a
momentary confusion—neither side has
any advantage.
One side surprised: The side that is not
surprised gains a one round advantage.
The surprised side cannot act that round.

Encounter Distance
The situation in which the encounter
occurs often determines how far away
the monster is. If there is uncertainty, the
encounter distance may be determined
randomly:
▶ Dungeon: 2d6 × 10 feet.
▶ Wilderness: 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 ×
10 yards if either side is surprised).
▶ Waterborne: 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 ×
10 yards if either side is surprised).

Initiative

Surprise
When to Check

A check for surprise is made for any side
that is not expecting the encounter. For
example, if a monster is waiting quietly
for an approaching party that is making a
lot of noise, the monster would not have
a chance to be surprised, but the party
would.
228

(See Combat, p234 for full details.)
Roll 1d6: For each side, at the start of
each round.
Winner: The side with the highest roll
acts first. Other sides act in order from
highest to lowest roll.
Ties: Either both sides may roll again,
or actions on both sides may be resolved
simultaneously.

Movement

Actions
Player Character Actions

The players decide how they will act.

Monster Actions

The referee determines monsters’ reaction to the party. Sometimes, circumstances make it obvious how a monster
will react. Otherwise, the referee may roll
on the table below to determine how a
monster reacts to the party.
Charisma: If one specific character
attempts to speak with the monsters, that
character’s NPC reactions modifier due to
CHA (see Ability Scores, p20) is used
to modify the monster reaction roll.

Common Actions

Hostile, attacks
Unfriendly, may attack
Neutral, uncertain
Indifferent, uninterested
Friendly, helpful

Any action is possible in an encounter,
but the following are common:
▶ Combat: If one side attacks, casts
spells, or makes tactical movement, begin
tracking time in rounds, following the
combat procedure (p234).
▶ Evasion: If one side decides to flee, the
other may decide to pursue. See Evasion.
▶ Parley: PCs may attempt to communicate with monsters. Opening an encounter in this way can influence the monsters’ behaviour (see Monster Actions). If
both sides decide to talk, the negotiation
may be role-played.

Encounter movement rate: During
encounters, a character can move up to
one third of their base movement rate
per round in feet (in the dungeon) or
yards (in the wilderness). For example, a
character whose base movement rate is
120’ could move 40’ per round during a
dungeon encounter.
Maximum duration: Characters may
move at this rate for at most 60 rounds
(one turn).

Evasion

If one side wishes to avoid an encounter,
it may attempt to flee. This is called evasion and is only possible before combat
has begun. When a side decides to attempt an evasion, the opposing side must
decide whether or not to pursue.
Players: May decide freely whether they
wish to pursue fleeing monsters.
Monsters: The referee must decide
whether monsters pursue fleeing PCs. (A
low roll on the Monster Reactions table
may be taken to indicate that the monster
will pursue.)
No pursuit: If the opposing side decides
to let the other side flee, then the evasion
automatically succeeds; the encounter is
avoided.
Pursuit: If the opposing side gives chase,
the chance of the evasion succeeding
depends on the environment being explored. See Evasion and Pursuit, p230.

Conclusion
An encounter is assumed to take at least
one full turn to complete, including time
to rest, regroup, clean weapons, bind
wounds, and so on, afterwards.

229

Evasion and Pursuit
In the Dungeon
Evasion

Compare the two sides’ movement rates:
▶ Fleeing side faster: The evasion automatically succeeds, unless the fleeing side
is forced to stop.
▶ Fleeing side not faster: A pursuit
occurs.

Pursuit

Time: Is measured in rounds (see Time,
Weight, and Movement, p214).
Running: Each side is assumed to be
running at full speed (see below).
Line of sight: Most monsters will not
continue a pursuit if the characters get
out of the monster’s range of vision.
Dropping treasure: If the monsters enjoy
treasure, there is a 3-in-6 probability that
they will stop pursuit to collect any treasure the characters drop.
Dropping food: Hungry or less intelligent monsters may stop pursuit if characters drop food (3-in-6 chance).
Obstacles: Burning oil or other obstacles
may also slow or stop a pursuit.

Running

Movement rate: During a pursuit, characters run at their base movement rate in
feet per round.
Mapping: Is not possible while running.
Exhaustion: Characters become exhausted after running for 30 rounds.
Effects of exhaustion: A –2 penalty to
attacks, damage, and Armour Class.
Resting: The penalties for exhaustion last
until characters have rested for three full
turns.
230

Waterborne
Evasion

The chance of evasion is determined by
the difference between the two sides’
movement rates, listed in the table below.
Success: If the evasion roll succeeds, the
pursuers cannot attempt to catch up with
the fleeing side until the next day—and
then only if a random encounter roll
indicates an encounter.
Failure: If the evasion roll fails, a pursuit
occurs.

Waterborne Evasion Chance

Time: Is measured in rounds (see Time,
Weight, and Movement, p214).
Initial distance: The two sides begin a
pursuit at normal encounter distance (see
Waterborne Adventuring, p226).
Closing in: The distance between the two
sides decreases by the difference between
their two movement rates each round (a
minimum of 30’ per round).

Evasion Modifiers

In the Wilderness
Evasion

The chance of evasion is a percentile
roll. If the percentile evasion roll fails, a
pursuit occurs. Surprise (see Encounters,
p228) determines the chance of evasion:
▶ No surprise: If neither side is surprised, the chance of evasion is determined by the relative size of the two
groups. (The chances are in favour of the
smaller group, as larger groups cannot
move as fast or as quietly.) The Wilderness Evasion Base Chance table indicates
the chance of evasion.
▶ Surprised side: May generally not
evade. The referee may rule that environmental conditions give a small chance of
evasion even when surprised (as above).
For example, dense woodland may give a
surprised side a 10% chance of evasion.
▶ Surprising side: If one side has surprised the other, the side with surprise
may evade automatically—the surprised
side is not even aware that the encounter
occurred.

Wilderness Evasion Base Chance
Fleeing Group Size
1–4
5–12
13–24
25+

One side twice as fast: If the pursuing
side’s movement rate is double that of the
other, the chance of evasion is decreased
by 25%. If the fleeing side’s movement
rate is double that of the other, the chance
of evasion is increased by 25%.
Environment: The referee may modify
the probabilities based on the conditions and environment. For example, in
a densely wooded area, the chance of
evasion may be increased by 25%.
Minimum chance: The chance of escape
is always at least 5%.

Pursuit

The following procedure is followed, day
by day, until the pursuit is over:
1. The fleeing side moves in a random direction, determined by the referee (no
mapping is possible).
2. If the pursuing side’s movement rate
is greater than that of the fleeing side,
there is a 50% chance of it catching
up. If the roll succeeds, the fleeing side
has been caught; the pursuit is over.
Otherwise, continue to step 3.
3. The fleeing side must decide whether
to continue fleeing. If it decides to
continue, it may make another evasion
attempt (see above). If the attempt
to evade fails, return to step 1. If the
fleeing group decides to stop fleeing, it
is caught (the pursuit ends).

Chance of Evasion by Number of Pursuers

1 pursuer: 50%
1–3 pursuers: 35%
1–6 pursuers: 25%
1–10 pursuers: 10%

2–3 pursuers: 70%
4+ pursuers: 90%
4–8 pursuers: 50%
9+ pursuers: 70%
7–16 pursuers: 35% 17+ pursuers: 50%
11–30 pursuers: 25% 31+ pursuers: 35%

Combat
Combat Sequence Per Round
1. Declare spells and melee movement
2. Initiative: Each side rolls 1d6.
3. Winning side acts:
a. Monster morale
b. Movement
c. Missile attacks
d. Spell casting
e. Melee attacks
4. Other sides act: In initiative order.

Declare Spells and Melee Movement
Players must inform the referee if they intend to cast a spell or move when in melee. Other actions need not be declared.

Initiative
Roll 1d6: For each side at the start of
each round.
Winner: The side with the highest roll
acts first. Other sides act in order from
highest to lowest roll.
Ties: Either both sides may roll again or
actions on both sides may be resolved simultaneously. (This means that both sides
may inflict deadly blows on each other!)

Slow Weapons

Combatants attacking with two-handed melee weapons (and some missile
weapons—as indicated in the equipment
description) always act last in the round,
as if they had lost initiative.

Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)

Instead of an initiative roll per side, a roll
may be made for each individual involved
in a battle, modified by DEX (see Ability
Scores, p20). The referee may determine an initiative modifier for monsters
that are very fast or slow, instead of
applying a DEX modifier.
234

Monster Morale (Optional Rule)
See Morale, p238.

Movement
Outside of Melee

Movement rate: Combatants can move
up to their encounter movement rate
each round.
Maximum duration: Combatants may
move at this rate for at most 60 rounds.

In Melee

When in melee with a foe, only the following forms of movement are possible:
▶ Fighting withdrawal: The combatant moves backwards at up to half their
encounter movement rate. There must be
a clear path for this movement.
▶ Retreat: The combatant turns and flees
from melee, moving up to their full encounter movement rate. This round: the
retreating combatant may not attack; the
opponent gains a +2 bonus to all attacks
against the retreating combatant and ignores any AC bonus due to the retreating
combatant’s shield (if applicable).

Missile Attacks
Are possible when opponents are more
than 5’ from one another. See Attacking.

Range Modifiers

All missile weapons have ranges, noted in
the equipment lists.
Short range: +1 bonus to attack rolls.
Medium range: No bonuses or penalties.
Long range: –1 penalty to attack rolls.
Beyond long range: Attack not possible.

Targets Behind Cover

Complete cover: The target cannot be hit.
Partial cover: The referee may apply attack penalties of between –1 and –4 (e.g.
a small table might incur a –1 penalty;
dense woods might incur a –4 penalty).

Spell Casting

Attack Rolls

Freedom: The spell caster must be able
to speak and move their hands. A spell
caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound,
or in an area of magical silence.
Sole action: When casting a spell, no
other actions may be taken in the round.
No movement: The spell caster cannot
move and cast a spell in the same round.
Line of sight: Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a specific
monster, character, or area of effect) must
be visible to the caster.

1. Roll 1d20
2. Apply modifiers: STR for melee;
DEX, range, cover for missile attacks.
3. Determine hit AC: Look up the
result in the attack matrix row for
the attacker’s THAC0 (see Attack
Matrix, p241). This indicates the
AC score that the attack hits.
4. Result: If the hit AC is equal to or
lower than the opponent’s AC, the
attack hits. Referee rolls for damage.

Disrupting Spells

If a spell caster loses initiative and is successfully attacked or fails a saving throw
before their turn, the spell being cast is
disrupted and fails. It is removed from
the caster’s memory as if it had been cast.

Melee Attacks
Are possible when opponents are 5’ or
less from each other. See Attacking.

Other Sides Act
Repeat steps 3a to 3e for each side, in
order of initiative (highest first).

Attacking
1s and 20s

Natural 20 attack rolls always hit. Natural
1 attack rolls always miss.

Invulnerabilities

Some monsters are immune to certain
attacks. In this case, even if an attack hits,
damage is not rolled.

Attacks Per Round

PCs normally attack once per round.
Some monsters have multiple attacks.

Attacking and Moving

Movement and attacking may be combined in the same round.

Ascending Armour Class (Optional Rule)

Groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC (see p13) should use the
following attack procedure instead.
1. Roll 1d20
2. Apply modifiers: STR for melee;
DEX, range, cover for missile attacks.
3. Determine hit AC: Add the attacker’s attack bonus. The result is the
ascending AC score the attack hits.
4. Result: If the hit AAC is equal to or
higher than the opponent’s AAC, the
attack hits. Referee rolls for damage.

Rolling for Damage

PC attacks: Inflict 1d6 damage. Damage
of melee attacks is modified by STR.
Monster attacks: Deal the damage indicated in the monster’s description.
Minimum damage: An attack which hits
always deals at least one point of damage,
even when damage modifiers reduce the
number rolled to 0 or less.
Death: A character or monster reduced
to 0 hit points or less is killed.

Variable Weapon Damage (Optional Rule)
Some groups may prefer different
weapons to inflict different amounts of
damage. In this case, PC attacks inflict
the damage indicated for the weapon in
the equipment lists.

235

Other Combat Issues Charging into Melee (Optional Rule)
Attacking from Behind
AC bonuses from shields are negated.

Attacking with Two Weapons
(Optional Rule)
Characters with DEX or STR as a prime
requisite may choose to wield two
one-handed weapons, as follows:
▶ The secondary weapon must be of
small size (e.g. a dagger or hand axe).
▶ Attacks with the primary weapon
suffer a –2 penalty.
▶ The character may make one extra
attack per round with the secondary
weapon, at a –4 attack penalty.

Blindness
A blind character is unable to attack.

Bombing
Flying creatures may pick up rocks or
other objects and drop them from above.
Altitude: At most 300’.
Chance to hit: 16 or higher on 1d20.
Affected area and damage: Depend on
the size of the bomb—larger creatures
can carry larger bombs. For example, a
bomb from a flying creature able to carry
a human might inflict 2d6 damage to all
creatures hit in a 10’ × 10’ area.

Once per combat, a character may charge
into melee and attack, as follows:
▶ The character moves at least 20’ (20
yards in the wilderness) before attacking.
There must be a clear run.
▶ The character gains a +2 bonus to
attack this round.
▶ The character’s AC is penalised by 1
this round.
▶ Weapons that may be braced against
charging monsters are also effective
against charging characters.

Invulnerabilities (Optional Rule)
Some monsters can only be harmed by
magical or silver weapons. The referee may allow such monsters to also be
harmed by attacks from:
▶ Another invulnerable monster.
▶ A monster with 5 HD or greater.

Missile Attacks on Targets in Melee
(Optional Rule)
The constant and unpredictable movement of characters in melee makes firing
or throwing missile weapons at combatants an uncertain proposition.
When this happens, randomly determine
which character in the melee is actually
targeted by the missile attack before making the attack roll.
Typically, all characters involved in the
melee have the same chance of being targeted, but especially large creatures may
count as two or more characters.

Paralysed Opponents
Helpless opponents, such as those magically paralysed or frozen, can be automatically hit in melee. Only a roll for damage
is required.
236

Parrying (Optional Rule)

Subduing (Optional Rule)

Characters with a STR of 13 or above
may opt to act purely defensively in
melee, forfeiting their attack that round.
When parrying, the character’s STR
bonus to melee attacks is applied as an
Armour Class bonus that round.

The referee should judge how many
attackers can strike at a single opponent,
bearing in mind the size of the opponent
and the available space around it.
10’ passage: Normally at most 2–3 characters can fight side-by-side in a 10’ wide
passageway.

Characters that wish to subdue an intelligent opponent must announce that they
are attacking without the intent to kill.
Blunt blows: Only bludgeoning attacks
may be made. Bladed melee weapons may
be employed to deal blunt blows with the
flat of the blade.
Subdual damage: Combat and damage
are calculated normally, but subdual
damage is noted separately from actual
damage.
Effect at 0hp: An intelligent character or
monster reduced to 0 hit points due to
subdual damage will surrender, realising
that its opponent could have killed it.

Splash Weapons (Optional Rule)

Unarmed Attacks

Targeting a Surface

Attack rolls: Unarmed combat is handled
the same as melee combat.
Damage: Unarmed attacks inflict 1d2
damage, modified by STR.

Spacing

Characters may attempt to throw a splash
weapon so that it smashes on a hard surface close to one or more creatures. This
is handled as an attack against AC 9 [10].
If the attack succeeds, all creatures within
5’ are splashed with the liquid and, if it is
harmful to them, suffer 1d2 damage.

Misses

When an attack with a splash weapon
misses its target (whether a character or a
surface), it lands in a random location:
▶ Roll 1d12 to determine the direction, interpreting the roll as a clock-face
direction.
▶ The container smashes 5’ from the
intended target in the specified direction.
▶ Creatures within 5’ of this location are
splashed with the liquid. If it is harmful
to them, they suffer 1d2 damage.

Unstable Surfaces
Characters on an unstable surface, such
as a ship in rough seas or riding a flying
animal, are affected as follows:
▶ Missile attacks: Suffer a –4 penalty.
▶ Spells: Cannot be cast.
▶ Magic items: Can be used normally.
Note that magical means of flight (e.g.
a magic broom, carpet, or the fly spell)
generally do not count as unstable.

Water
When fighting in or beneath water:
▶ Penalties: Attack and damage rolls
should be penalised.
▶ Missile weapons: Usually do not work
at all underwater.

237

Morale
(Optional Rule)
In combat, the referee decides whether
monsters or NPCs surrender or run away.
The following system may be utilised.

Morale Rating
Monsters have a listing for morale, rated
from 2 to 12, which represents how likely
they are to fight or flee. Higher morale
scores indicate more fearless monsters.
A score of 2: Means the monster never
fights. No morale checks should be made.
A score of 12: Means the monster will
fight until killed, never checking morale.

Morale Checks
The referee rolls 2d6 and compares the
result against the monster’s morale score:
▶ Higher than morale score: The monster will surrender or attempt to flee.
▶ Equal to or lower than morale score:
The monster will continue to fight.
Two successes: If a monster makes two
successful morale checks in an encounter,
it will fight until killed, with no further
checks necessary.

When to Check Morale
The referee usually makes a morale check
for monsters under two conditions:
First death on side: The first time one of
their number is killed in battle.
Side half incapacitated: When half the
monsters have been killed or otherwise
incapacitated.

238

Situational Adjustments
The referee may decide to apply bonuses
or penalties to morale (from –2 to +2),
depending on the circumstances. For
example, the side that is losing or winning might receive a penalty or bonus to
morale of –1 or +1, respectively.
Scores of 2 or 12: Adjustments are never
applied to monsters with a morale of 2
or 12.

Mercenary Morale
Mercenaries (see p112) have a morale
rating and check morale in exactly the
same way as monsters.
Morale rating: Determined solely by the
type of troops, see below. The CHA of the
hiring character has no influence.
Modifiers: The morale score of a group
of mercenaries may be modified based
on working conditions, at the referee’s
discretion. If mercenaries from the group
are being killed frequently or subjected
to other abuses, morale will be low. If
the mercenaries are enjoying riches and
excitement, it might be higher.

Retainer Morale
Retainers signed up to work as adventurers, so are not frightened off at the first
sign of danger. Retainers do not make
morale checks in combat, but a loyalty
check may be required in extreme peril
(see Retainers, p110).

239

Combat Tables
These tables list the attack probabilities
for all monsters and characters and the
saving throw values used by monsters
and normal humans.

Normal Humans
All humans who are not a member of an
adventuring class are classified as normal
humans. They are treated as having less
than 1 Hit Die and have their own saving
throw and attack probabilities (the table
rows labelled NH).

Example of Making an Attack Roll
A 5th level fighter attacks a monster with
AC 4. The attack is resolved as follows:
1. The player rolls 1d20. The roll comes
up 14.
2. The fighter has a STR score of 13,
meaning they gain a +1 bonus to melee attack rolls. The result of the attack
roll is thus 15.
3. A 5th level fighter has a THAC0 score
of 17 [+2] (listed in the class description), so the player refers to that row
of the attack matrix.
4. The player looks up the result (15) in
the THAC0 17 [+2] attack matrix row.
15 is in the AC 2 column, indicating
that the attack hits AC 2.
5. As AC 2 is better than the monster’s
Armour Class (4), the attack hits!
6. Damage is rolled and the result subtracted from the monster’s current hit
point total.

Attack Rolls Using THAC0
(Optional Rule)
Instead of referring to the attack matrix,
attacks may be resolved using THAC0
directly. A THAC0 score denotes the attack roll required to hit AC 0. The attack
roll required to hit opponents of other
AC scores can be calculated by subtracting the target AC from the THAC0. For
example, a character with a THAC0 of
19 could hit an opponent with AC 5 on
a roll of 14 or greater (19 – 5 = 14).
Note: Using THAC0 to resolve attack
rolls results in very slightly different
attack probabilities than when using the
traditional approach of referring to the
attack matrix.

Monsters: Use the attack matrix row for their Hit Dice (see monster description).
Monsters with bonus hit points: Monsters whose Hit Dice are notated as a number of
dice plus a fixed hit point bonus (e.g. HD 2+1) are more powerful and attack as if they
were 1 HD higher. For example, a monster with 2 HD uses the THAC0 18 [+1] row, but
a monster with 2+1 HD uses the THAC0 17 [+2] row.
Characters: Use the attack matrix row for their THAC0 score (see class description).
Normal humans: Use the attack matrix row labelled NH.
