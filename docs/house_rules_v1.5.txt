Beast Master

Requirements
Type of animals: Both wild and domestic
animals may be companions. Giant or
magical animals may be companions at
the referee’s discretion.

Requirements: None
Prime requisite: STR and WIS
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, chainmail, shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common

Maximum companions: A beast master
may have up to one animal companion
per experience level. The total Hit Dice of
companions may not exceed the character’s
experience level.

Beast masters are adventurers with a special
connection to animals. They are often
accompanied by one or more loyal beasts.
Prime requisites: A beast master with at
least 13 in one prime requisite gets +5% to
XP. If both STR and WIS are 16 or higher,
the character gets a +10% bonus.”

Animal Companions
A beast master may attempt to forge a
bond with an encountered animal. If the
attempt succeeds, the animal becomes the
beast master’s loyal companion.
Establishing a Connection
The beast master must approach the
animal in a peaceful manner. The referee
makes a reaction roll. If the result is 8
or greater, the animal becomes the beast
master’s companion.

Death or dismissal: If an animal
companion dies or is dismissed, the beast
master may attempt to forge a connection
with a new animal.

Clairvoyance
After reaching 5th level, a beast master
can see through the eyes of their animal
companions, wherever they may be. This
requires deep concentration.

Combat
Beast masters can use all types of weapons
and can use leather armour, chainmail,and
shields.

Companions’ Behaviour
Once a connection is successfully
established, the animal companion will
follow the beast master everywhere. It
obeys basic commands from the beast
master and will fight to defend the beast
master, never checking morale.

After Reaching 9th Level

A beast master gains a +1 bonus to reaction
rolls made when interacting with animals,
in addition to their CHA modifier. (See
Encounters in Old-School Essentials.)

A beast master may construct a stronghold
in the wilderness. Animals within a 5
mile radius of the stronghold will become
friends with the beast master. They may
warn of intruders, carry messages and
news, and so on. In exchange for this
friendship, the beast master must protect
the animals from harm.

behind a beast master’s words.
▶ From 2nd level: The beast master can
also understand the speech of animals.
▶ From 4th level: The beast master can

Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 14
Armor: None
Weapons: Dagger, shortsword, staff,

cast spells from arcane scrolls and use any
items that may only be used by arcane
spell casters (e.g. magic wands).

turn.
▶ Read magic (RM): Allows the mage

Afterwards,
subjects realise they have been tricked.
This skill may be used once per turn.

blades, but cannot use armor.

will arrive to study under the mage.

Rolling Skill Checks
All skills are rolled on d%, with a result of
less than or equal to the listed percentage
indicating success.
Player Knowledge

Warden

Foraging and Hunting
A party with a warden succeeds at foraging
with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey
when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance (see
Wilderness Adventuring in Old-School
Essentials).

Requirements: Minimum CON 9,
minimum WIS 9
Prime requisite: STR
Hit Dice: 1d8
Maximum level: 14
Armor: Leather, chain mail, shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Common

Limited Possessions

Wardens are members of a secret society
which protects their native lands from
invasion and the influence of evil. They
are skilled warriors who are adapted to
life in the wilds.
Alignment: As protectors, wardens may
only be good or neutral alignment. If a
warden ever changes alignment to evil, they
lose all special class abilities and become a
fighter of the same level. The character may
be able to regain their status as a warden by
performing a special quest.

Awareness
Wardens are only surprised on a roll of
1. This may mean that a warden is able
to act in the surprise round while their
companions are surprised.

A warden may only keep wealth and possessions that can be kept on their person
or mount. Excess must be donated to
worthy causes (not other PCs!).

Pursuit
When the warden’s party pursues an
opposing group in the wilderness (see
Evasion and Pursuit in Old-School
Essentials), the chance of evasion is
reduced by 10%.

Surprise Attack
In the wilderness, a warden has a 3-in-6
chance of going unnoticed when sneaking
up on a target. If the warden goes unnoticed, the target may be surprised (see
Surprise under Encounters in Old-School
Essentials).

Combat
Wardens can use all types of weapons and
can use leather armors, chain mail, and
shields. Because of their need for stealth,
they cannot use plate mail.

House Rules v.1.5

Attacking (cont.)
Natural 20/1 Attack Rolls
fNatural 20 attack rolls always hit (within
reason), and the Critical Hit chart will
be consulted for additional effects.
fNatural 1 attack rolls always miss and the
Critical Miss chart will be consulted for
additional consequences.
Opportunity Attacks
During movement, a combatant that passes
into and then out of melee range of an
opponent, triggers an Opportunity Attack.
fThe Opportunity Attack happens
immediately and out of turn order.
fThe opponent must have an available
attack, this does not provide a free or
additional attack.
Parry/Dodge
A combatant may choose to forgo attacking
and moving and instead focus on parrying/
dodging blows. All attacks against such a
combatant are made at a -2 penalty.

Splash Weapons
Optional Splash Weapons rules will be
used.
fWhen a splash attack misses, the attack
lands in an adjacent area. On a square
grid, roll 1d8 to determine direction.

Targets Behind Cover
Combatants behind cover are more difficult
to hit.
f¼ cover provides a +1 to AC.
f½ cover provides a +2 to AC.
f¾ cover provides a +4 to AC.
fCombatants behind full cover cannot be
hit by direct attacks.

Ranged Attacks
fRanged attacks cannot be made if there
is an opponent within melee range of the
attacker.
Second Rank Attacks
Combatants using weapons with the Reach
property may attack through allied squares.
fAttackers one size larger than the ally
suffer no attack penalty.
fIf both the attacker and the ally are of the
same size, or the attacker is a size smaller
than the ally, the attack is at a -2 penalty
to hit.

House Rules v.1.5

13

Combat Movement
5’ Squares
Only one combatant may occupy a 5’
square.
fCombatants may pass through an ally
occupied square at twice the movement
cost, but may not pass through an
opponent’s square.
fCombatants may pass through the square
of any deceased ally/opponent at twice
the movement cost.
fCombatants may occupy the square of
any deceased ally or opponent.
Combat Movement Speed
Movement in combat consists of two types:
Encounter Speed and Running Speed.
fEncounter Speed is the distance a
combatant may move and still engage
in combat (i.e. melee or ranged). Base
Encounter Speed is 30’ for all races.
fRunning Speed is the maximum
distance a combatant may travel if they
forgo attacking. This distance is equal to
twice the combatant’s Encounter Speed.
Melee Range
A combatant is considered within melee
range if they are within 5’ of an opponent,
or within 10’ of an opponent using a
weapon with the Reach property.

Miscellaneous Combat
Ascending Armor Class
Optional Ascending Armor Class (AAC)
rules will be used.
Changing Weapons & Attacking
A combatant engaged in melee may only
switch weapons and attack if the current
weapon is dropped.

14

Helpless Opponents
Any opponent who is bound, frozen,
unconscious, etc., is hit automatically for
maximum damage by any melee attack.
Morale
Optional Morale rules will be used.
Oil and Fire
Unless prepared ahead of time, oil flasks
cannot be lit and thrown in the same
round.
fThe first round includes grabbing
the flask, removing the stopper, and
preparing the wick.
fThe second round includes lighting the
wick and throwing the flask.
fOn a successful hit, the opponent takes
1d4 points of damage.
fThe next round the opponent will take an
additional 1d4 damage.
Ranged Attacks on Targets in Melee
Due to the unpredictability of combatants
engaged melee, firing ranged weapons into
melee is risky. If a combatant fires into
melee and misses the target, the reverse
of the roll is taken (e.g. a 2 becomes an
18, a 5 becomes a 15, etc.) and applied
against the other combatants, friend or
foe. If the reverse of the roll is equal to or
greater than the AC of another combatant,
that combatant is hit. If there are multiple
combatants with the same AC, a random
roll will determine which is struck.
Slow Weapons
Slow Weapon rules will not be used.
Variable Weapon Damage
Optional Variable Weapon Damage rules
will be used.

House Rules v.1.5

Spellbooks

Incapacitated
An incapacitated combatant:
•Cannot attack or cast spells.
• Falls prone and can only move by
dragging their body at a speed of 5’ per
round.
•Suffers a -4 penalty on all saving
throws.
•Is always attacked at a +4 advantage.

All arcane spells must be stored in a
spellbook. Each spell requires one page/
level. If a spellbook is lost or destroyed, the
caster can no longer memorize their spells.

Spellcasting Focus
Spellcasters of any type require an object
which helps to create and focus their
mystical energies (e.g. staff, wand, crystal,
instrument, or holy symbol). Without it,
the spellcaster cannot guide their mystic
energies to create the spell.

Wild Magic
Magic is a powerful and sometimes
unpredictable force. When casting a spell,
whether Arcane or Divine, a “to-hit” roll
must be made.
• On a roll of 20, the spell results in
a Boon. A Boon is some additional,
powerful, or and helpful result.
• On a roll of 1, the spell results
in a Bane. A Bane is some wild,
unpredicatble, or possibly even
harmful result.
• Wild Magic affects all forms of magic
across all character classes.

Strength Adjustments to Encumbrance

We will use Detailed Encumbrance based
on Coin Weights (CW). Coin Weight is an
abstract combination of physical weight
and bulk. As a rough estimate, 10 coins
regardless of their material (gold, silver, or
copper), weigh approximately 1lb.

A character’s Strength (STR) score will
have an effect on the amount of weapons,
armor, and equipment they can carry. A
stronger character can obviously carry
more than their weaker counterparts.

Critical Misses
d100 Effect
01-20

Clumsy footwork has caused the combatant to injure a knee or ankle (or other mobility appendage).
Encounter and Running speeds are cut in half until the next day unless healed through magic.

21-30

The attacker must make a Moderate DEX check or fumble their weapon into an adjacent square.
Use Splash Weapons rules to determine the direction.

31-40

The combatant overextends, opening its defenses to a counter attack. Attacks from any opponent are
at +2 for the remainder of the current round.

41-50

Awkward foot placement during the attack puts the combatant off balance. Make a Moderate DEX
check or fall Prone. If the combatant has movement remaining and chooses to stand, it provokes an
Opportunity Attack from any opponent within 5’.

51-60

The combatant’s overexertion causes them to lose control of their bowels. Roll d100. On a 75 or less
it’s only pee. The combatant’s square is now difficult terrian.

61-70

The combatant’s erratic manuevering causes an item (backpack, scabbard, ammo container, etc.) in
their posession to dislodge and fall to the ground. The combatant’s square is now difficult terrain.

71-75

The opponent has trapped the attacker’s weapon. Next turn the attacker may attempt to free it by
making a Moderate STR check. The opponent has +2 on attacks until weapon is freed. If the attacker
is using a ranged weapon, the weapon has become entangled in their personal gear.

76-80

While repositioning, the combatant slips on a banana peel and falls to the floor. Roll a Moderate
CON check or be knocked Unconscious for the remainder of the current round and the next. On a
successful check, the combatant is Incapacitated for the remainder of the current round.

81-85

Something gets in the attacker’s eyes (sweat, dirt, blood, etc.) making it impossible to see clearly. The
combatant is subject to Blind Fighting rules for the remainder of the current round and the next.

86-90

Weapon breaks. If the weapon is magical/enchanted, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the weapon breaks. An
enchanted weapon that breaks releases magical energy causing 1d4 damage to all combatants within

D6 Thief Skills

Miscellaneous

Thief Skills

Turning Undead

All thief skill checks will be rolled on a d6
rather than with percentile dice. All thief
skills, including those shared with the
Assassin and the Barbarian, function as
described in the Players Tome, with the
exception of Pick Pockets.

Limits on Turning Undead
fFrequency and Duration rules will be
used.
fMixed groups of undead rules will be
used, but the turning attempts must
be sequential. If the turning attempt
is interrupted (by a successful attack
or some other external event), or the
character performs a different action the
following round, the effect ends and can’t
be attempted again that encounter.

Pick Pockets
The chance of success is reduced by 1-in-6
per three levels of the victim (e.g. a 6th level
victim reduces success by 2-in-6). A roll of
6 means that the attempted theft
is noticed. The DM determines the reaction
of the victim.

Mechanics
Base chance of success: All skills begin
with a 1-in-6 chance of success.

Trade Tongue
The common language of the realm is a
hybrid language consisting of Old Oeridian
and Ancient Baklunish. It is known as the
“Trade Tongue” of the Flanaess.

Expertise points: Each class using d6 Thief
Skills will gain expertise points to improve
their chance of success with their skills.
Each point allocated to a skill improves the
chance of success by 1-in-6. Multiple points
may be allocated to a skill, further increasing the chance of success. For example, if
2 points are allocated to a skill, the chance
of success is raised to 3-in-6 (from the base
1-in-6 chance of success).
